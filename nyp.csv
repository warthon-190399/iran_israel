					TikToker Elica Le Bon said Iranians like her only want peace. 				



An Iranian-American lawyer and TikToker hit out at the Islamic Republic’s regime and its cheerleaders advocating for a war with Israel, arguing that everyday Iranians only “want peace.”
Elica Le Bon, a British-born, American-educated attorney boasting more than 300,000 followers across the various social media platforms, released a video on TikTok Sunday carrying a powerful anti-war message that has gone viral, drawing more than a million views.
“Hi, Iranian woman here,” Le Bon says at the start of the clip. “It’s become very apparent that you haven’t been listening to anything that we’ve had to say for the past two years, but I was wondering if you could just lend me a few minutes of your time in this ungodly hour to hear us now.”

Le Bon, who has used her online clout to combat Iranian propaganda and disinformation in recent years, blasted supporters of the Tehran regime for backing the historic drone and missile attack on Israel Saturday by arguing that it was an act of self-defense following an Israeli strike on an Iranian embassy complex in Syria.

								The epic fail of Biden’s doctrine vs. Iran — no consequences							










“In what capacity have you distorted the story to make the Islamic Republic the victim?” Le Bon incredulously wondered.
Le Bon drew a distinction between the nation of Iran and its ruling regime, insisting that what the hardliner theocratic government does “is not a reflection of the Iranian people.”
“We’ve been clear about what we want, which is peace,” she proclaimed.
The influencer further took pro-Tehran commenters to task for turning a blind eye to the mass protests led by Iranian women demanding reforms who are being jailed and killed for their activism, only to come out in full force to support the attack on Israel.
“When we were screaming that they were killing Iranian women for not wearing a hijab, where were you?” Le Bon demanded. “When they were lynching Iranian men from cranes for protesting, where were you? When we were explaining that it’s a terrorist occupying force, where were you?”
“But all of a sudden everyone’s graduated from Instagram school of law to say that it’s a violation of international law and Iran has the right to defend itself,” she seethed.

Le Bon went on to argue that far from being a victim, the Islamic Republic of Iran was the aggressor responsible for creating “terror proxies,” including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen, for the sole purpose of fostering regional instability.
“Did you think they were there to instigate a system of public schooling and education, to feed the poor, house the unhoused? What did you think that they were there for?” she sarcastically remarked.
Le Bon also bristled at Iran’s claim that the Israeli bombing of its compound in Damascus on April 1 was an act of war, pointing out that it came after Hamas launched a murderous attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and that Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel “on a near daily basis.”
“Iranians don’t want war with Israel. We want peace with Israel. Iranian people inside of Iran have come out and said this over, and over and over again,” Le Bon said.

The Israeli government was said to be mulling a retaliation for Saturday’s Iranian barrage that saw more than 300 drones and missiles rain down on its territory, leaving a 7-year-old girl seriously injured.
Israel’s European allies urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet to show restraint and avoid escalating the conflict further amid the ongoing war with Hamas.

Shocking video captured anti-Israel activists in Chicago chanting “death to Israel” and “death to America” in Farsi  over the weekend, just hours before Iran launched its anticipated drone and missile attack on the Jewish state.
The chants in Iran’s native language were recorded during a “break out session” for the Anti-War Committee Chicago on Saturday, where organizer Shabbir Rizvi taught about 80 participants how to say “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” in Farsi, The Free Press reported. 
Rizvi tells attendees he is about to teach them a saying they can use if they ever encounter “Zionist freaks.” 
He then leads the so-called anti-war group in a chant of “Marg bar Israel.”
After the chant concludes Rizvi clarifies to attendees that the saying “has two meanings, depending on who’s asking.”

To teach the attendees — nearly all of whom are wearing black KF94 masks — the chant, he jokes that it’s like saying “margarita bar.”
Later, the crowd laughs as Rizvi explains, “It can either mean, ‘death to,’ or ‘down with.'” 
After teaching the leftists how to saying “death to Israel,” one person chimes in: “Can we get a marg bar America?”
Rizvi can be seen raising his hands in the air and leading the crowd like a conductor in a chant of “Marg bar America!” 
The disturbing incident occurred mere hours before Iran’s anticipated attack on Israel on Saturday. 



The video was taken Saturday ahead of Iran’s anticipated attack on Israel.  Getty Images
The move comes in retaliation after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
 Saturday’s strike saw some 300 drones and missiles launched from within the Islamic Republic — as well as from proxies in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon toward Israel. 
Only one casualty — a 7-year-old Israeli-Arab girl — has been identified so far.

The “vast majority” of the missiles were intercepted outside of air space, by Israeli air defenses, with the help of US, French and UK ships and warplanes shooting them out of the sky. 
Fighter jets from Jordan also assisted, though the Middle Eastern country claimed it was not helping Israel but rather defending its own air space.

President Biden is “sleepwalking” the US into another “catastrophic” war in the Middle East, an expert says, as Israel prepares a retaliatory strike after Iran’s historic missile bombardment over the weekend.
Biden, 81, is facing mounting pressure to silence critics who claim he’s allowed tensions in the region to escalate, as the threat of an Israeli counterstrike on Iran looms.

President Joe Biden has been accused of “sleepwalking” the US into yet another “catastrophic” war in the Middle East. AP
“The strategy of the Biden administration has failed miserably. Biden is sleepwalking the US into another catastrophic war in the Middle East,” Fawaz Gerges, professor of International Relations and Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics told NBC News.
“His overarching goal of preventing the war in Gaza from escalating into neighboring countries has failed. Biden has failed to influence [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s decisions either in Gaza or towards Iran.”






Elsewhere, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Peter Lerner confirmed on Monday that Israel’s retaliation could mean “strike or no strike.”
Lerner said that they are considering a “wide range of options” as there are “a lot of different scenarios” to consider.
He told reporters that the Israeli government will “decide on the steps forward” in the coming days.

“Just because we were successful in intercepting, we shouldn’t underestimate what Iran did,” Lerner added.
Netanyahu’s war cabinet was expected to meet Monday afternoon local time to decide on Israel’s next steps.
Israeli officials said the war cabinet favored retaliation but was split over the timing and scale of the response.

Biden has warned Netanyahu the US will not participate in any Israeli counteroffensive against Iran, American officials said.
With Israel and Iran now teetering on the brink of open warfare, Jerusalem’s European allies rushed to call for restraint.
“We’re on the edge of the cliff and we have to move away from it,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. “We have to step on the brakes and reverse gear.”

UK’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron sought to downplay Saturday night’s attack, which saw more than 300 Iranian kamikaze drones and missiles fired into Israel, as he strongly advocated against an escalation.
“Of course if you’re sitting in Israel this morning, you’re thinking quite rightly, ‘We have every right to respond,’ and they do,” he told Sky News. “But we are urging that they should not escalate.”
“In many ways this has been a double defeat for Iran,” Cameron continued. “The attack has been almost a total failure and they revealed to the world that they are the malign influence in the region prepared to do this. So our hope is that there won’t be a retaliatory response.”

French President Emmanuel Macron likewise urged Israel to set its sight on isolating Iran rather than escalating the situation — while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned Iran not to carry out more attacks.
The unprecedented Iranian attack, which was launched in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on its embassy in Syria on April 1, caused fairly minor damage, with most of the missiles and drones being shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome defenses and allied forces from the US, France, the UK and Jordan.

The only serious injury reported inside Israel was a 7-year-old girl from a Bedouin community who was struck in the head by shrapnel.
The child, who was not unidentified, remained in a life-threatening condition at Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba after undergoing surgery, reported Times of Israel.
“It fell on us into the house at around 2 in the morning. She was sleeping in the house and we immediately took her to Soroka hospital,” the girl’s father Mohammed said.

President Joe Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the US will not take part in a counter-offensive against Iran, an option Netanyahu’s war cabinet favors after a mass drone and missile attack on Israeli territory, according to officials.
The threat of open warfare erupting between the arch Middle East foes and dragging in the United States put the region on edge, triggering calls for restraint from global powers and Arab nations.
“The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a Security Council meeting called on Sunday in response to the strikes.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood called on the council to unequivocally condemn Iran’s attack.

“Let me be clear: if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible,” he said.

Still, Biden told Netanyahu the US would not participate in any Israeli counter-offensive against Iran over the attack, a White House official said.
US State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke to counterparts including in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, stressing the need to avoid escalation, the importance of a coordinated diplomatic response, and emphasizing the US will continue to support Israel’s defense.
LITTLE SERIOUS DAMAGE
Iran launched the attack over a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed top Revolutionary Guards commanders and followed months of clashes between Israel and Iran’s regional allies, triggered by the war in Gaza.

However, the attack by more than 300 missiles and drones caused only modest damage in Israel. Most were shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system and with help from the US, Britain, France and Jordan.
The only serious injury reported within Israel was a 7-year-old who was hurt by shrapnel.
There also was little serious property damage reported. Authorities said an Israeli Air Force base was hit but continued to operate as normal.

Asian shares fell and gold prices rose on Monday as risk sentiment took a hit, though oil prices dipped.
“An attack was largely priced in the days leading up to it. Also the limited damage and the fact that there was no loss of life means that maybe Israel’s response will be more measured,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING.
“But clearly, there is still plenty of uncertainty and it all depends on how Israel now responds.”

Israeli officials said Netanyahu’s five-member war cabinet favored retaliation in a meeting on Sunday, although the panel was divided over the timing and scale of any such response.
Two senior Israeli ministers signalled retaliation was not imminent and that Israel would not act alone.
“We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” centrist minister Benny Gantz said ahead of a war cabinet meeting.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said Israel had an opportunity to form a strategic alliance “against this grave threat by Iran.”
Israel remained on high alert, but authorities lifted some emergency measures that had included a ban on some school
activities and caps on large gatherings.

Iranian army chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said on television, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran,” and told Washington that its bases could also be attacked if it helped Israel retaliate.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Tehran had informed the United States its attack on Israel would be limited and for self-defense and that regional neighbors had been informed of its planned strikes 72 hours in advance.
Turkish, Jordanian and Iraqi officials said on Sunday that Iran gave wide notice days before the attack, but US officials said Tehran did not warn Washington and was aiming to cause significant damage.

The leaders of the Group of 7 nations condemned Iran’s attack and said they would work to stabilize the situation, warning in a statement that Tehran risked “an uncontrollable regional escalation.”
MOTIVATIONS FOR ATTACK DEBATED
Analysts debated whether Iran’s attack was calibrated to cause genuine devastation in Israel, or to save face at home after vows of revenge while avoiding a major new war.
“I think the Iranians took into consideration the fact that Israel has a very, very strong multi-layer anti-missile system and they probably took into consideration that there will not be too many casualties,” said Sima Shine, a former senior Mossad official at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.

In Gaza, Iran’s attack drew applause as rare payback for an Israeli offensive that has killed at least 33,000 people.
“We have been slaughtered for over six months and no one dared to do anything. Now Iran, after its consulate was hit, is hitting back at Israel and this brings joy into our hearts,” said Majed Abu Hamza of Gaza City.
The war in Gaza, which Israel invaded after an attack by Iran-backed Hamas on Oct. 7, has spread to fronts with Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
In Israel, although there was alarm at the first direct attack from another country in more than three decades, the mood contrasted with the trauma after the Hamas-led attack on Oct.7.
“I think we’ve been given license to respond now. I mean it was a major attack from Iran… I imagine Israel will respond and may be over quickly and get back to normal life,” said Jeremy Smith, 60.
In Iran, state television showed small gatherings in several cities celebrating the attack, but in private some Iranians were worried about Israel’s response.
“Iran gave Netanyahu a golden opportunity to attack our country. But we, the people of Iran, will bear the brunt of this conflict,” said Shima, a nurse, from Tehran.

					President Joe Biden's desperation for a renewed nuclear deal was never clearer than in October, just days after the Hamas massacre, says columnist Richard Goldberg. 						
							AP/Alex Brandon						




President Biden needs to face reality: His policies of appeasing Iran while waging political warfare against Israel led Tehran to conclude it could launch a massive attack on Israel and face no consequences. 
As Biden again tries to hold Israel back from defending itself while maintaining both United States and United Nations sanctions relief for Iran, he risks confirming the ayatollah’s calculation — and guaranteeing a more dangerous future for America and our democratic allies.
Iran’s weekend attack against Israel was not symbolic or performative — it was an unprecedented and unacceptable act of war. 
There’s no other way to characterize the launch of 120 ballistic missiles, alongside 30 cruise missiles and 170 suicide drones, against a country the size of New Jersey — especially when the attack was committed by the state sponsor of terrorism already waging a multifront proxy war against that country.
Two questions now loom largest: Why did this happen and what is to be done?
Wasted diplomacy

Over the past six months, Washington has pressured Jerusalem not to escalate against Iran’s terror proxy in southern Lebanon, despite the daily launch of missiles, rockets and drones that has forced towns across northern Israel to evacuate.

		Did Israel surrender to White House pressure in Gaza? Iran likely thinks so	





Hezbollah’s war on Israel has been normalized due to the lack of severe consequences imposed on the group and its sponsor. 
The same can be said for the near-daily missile and drone attacks on the Red Sea by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, where the US won’t even put the group on an official terror list let alone impose true military costs on its leaders.
All the while, the White House has been showering Tehran with access to cash in hopes of incentivizing better behavior — a policy more commonly known as appeasement. 
America today does not enforce its oil sanctions on Iran, allowing Iranian crude to freely flow to China and other Asian destinations. 
Just last month, Biden renewed a sanctions waiver giving Iran access to upwards of $10 billion to be used as budget support.
Biden’s desperation for a renewed nuclear deal was never clearer than in October, just days after the Hamas massacre, when he allowed the UN’s missile embargo on Iran to expire rather than work with European allies to trigger the “snapback” of UN sanctions — a mechanism to restore all multilateral restrictions on Iran without a Russian or Chinese veto.
Oct. 7 accountability
Iran has faced no consequences from the US for Oct. 7, despite years of funding, training and arming Hamas. 
Nor has Iran faced consequences for directing missile attacks against Israel from Lebanon, missile attacks against the US Navy from Yemen and missile and drone attacks on both Israel and US forces from Iraq and Syria — even after the murder of three American soldiers.

		Biden should draw red lines for Hamas — not Israel	





Instead, the president’s public wrath in recent weeks has been aimed at Israel: pressuring Israel to halt its campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza, threatening a cutoff of US support, doing nothing to stop Canada from halting arms sales and emboldening Democrats in Congress to call for conditioning American aid. 
It’s quite logical for the mullahs to examine the record and conclude a strategic-level strike on Israel would end in two results: zero consequences for Tehran and pressure on Israel not to respond. As of this moment, they are being proven right.
Israel, however, has no choice but to respond forcefully to this attack — imposing costs high enough on Tehran to turn the ayatollah’s calculation into a miscalculation. 
Normalizing ballistic and cruise missile strikes from Iranian territory — whether they succeed in breaking through Israeli missile defenses or not — will establish a new and outrageously high baseline for future escalation. It may also inform the regime’s calculus on whether and when to pursue a nuclear breakout, doubting there is any level of misbehavior that could break Western appeasement policies.
Stop Tehran cash flow 
The president reportedly wants Israel to hold off on a military retaliation so he can pursue diplomatic options instead. 
But if those options exclude economic and political costs for the regime, Biden will simply be putting lipstick on a policy of accommodation.

The president should immediately freeze the $10 billion made available to Iran through his own sanctions waiver — money that’s accessible right now in bank accounts in Iraq, Oman and Europe. 
He should order a crackdown on Chinese imports of Iranian crude, too. If he refuses, the Senate should finally vote on two House-passed bills that would force his hand on both matters.
On the multilateral stage, the White House should join with the United Kingdom, France and Germany in triggering the snapback of UN sanctions and press Britain, Canada and the European Union to finally designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. Canada should be pressured to lift its arms embargo on Israel, too.
Both the US and Israel must recognize Iran carried out its attack despite a week of warnings from both countries. That is not a “win” — that’s a national-security failure, which should compel an immediate change in strategy.

		Hooray for Israel! Now Biden should back Israel’s  response vs. Iran — no ifs, ands or buts

					President Joe Biden should be backing an Israeli response, writes The Post Editorial Board. 						
							REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz						




Hooray for the good guys!
Israel, with the help of allies, took out 99% of the 300-plus attack drones, cruise and ballistic missiles Iran fired at it over the weekend. 
It’s a stunning victory!
President Biden and leaders of France, Britain and even Jordan deserve praise for helping to repel the outrageous strike.
Yes, Israelis went through hell, scurrying to shelters late at night, unsure if the missiles and drones would reach them.

Fortunately, only a few did, causing minimal damage — though one 7-year-old, sadly, was seriously injured.

								Don’t overlook the Chinese threat							










Still, such a massive attack, directly by Iran, might never have happened at all if not for catastrophic Biden administration policy.
Nor can it go unanswered.
And Biden should be backing an Israeli response, not looking to thwart it.
Tehran had vowed to hit the Jewish state after an Israeli airstrike on a Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards hub in Damascus killed a key commander, Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
Zahedi had overseen operations by Hezbollah (essentially, Iran’s military wing in Lebanon) and coordinated with other terror groups.
He’s suspected of having played a role in Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre of Israelis as well as the drone strike that killed three US soldiers in Jordan.

The media wrongly portray Iran’s strike attack as “retaliation,” but it was Israel’s killing of Zahedi that was retaliation, and a preemptive move to thwart further strikes.
(You could well argue that America itself should’ve taken out that Damascus facility, and Zahedi, after the murder of US soldiers.)
Iran’s weekend barrage was, in fact, escalation, not only because Zahedi had it coming, but because it was launched directly by Iran itself, not by proxies — and, for the first time ever, from its own soil, at Israel’s soil.

		As Iran readies to attack Israel, remember this is Biden’s design	






Where did Tehran’s leaders get the idea they can get away with such a volatile move?
From the White House — and Democratic critics like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
For months, Biden has scolded Israel for its drive to wipe out Hamas after its Oct. 7 slaughterfest.
He and his team have worked overtime to prevent the Jewish state from attacking Hamas’ remaining battalions in Rafah, citing potential harm to civilians.
Iran saw Washington distancing itself from Jerusalem and figured it wouldn’t back it if attacked.
Tehran also knows Team Biden’s eager to carry out the Obama policy of appeasing Iran in a deranged bid to bolster ties and perhaps reform the mullahs.
Team Obama, recall, provided Iran with tens of billions of dollars, in exchange for a disastrous nuclear deal that, thank goodness, President Donald Trump discarded.
Alas, Biden has tried to revive that deal, and, to that end, he’s allowed Iran to violate sanctions and reap billions in oil sales with impunity.
He’s also freed up billions in additional frozen funds and even let UN sanctions on Iran’s missiles and drones (the kind used in its weekend attack) lapse.

		Biden is dreaming it’s like 1918, but Israel is fighting like it’s 1945	





Most troubling, he’s failed to respond meaningfully to attacks and provocations by Iran’s proxies.
After Oct. 7, he told anyone thinking of joining in the attacks, “don’t.”
Yet Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iranian-backed militias nonetheless have launched drones and rockets at Israeli and Western targets almost daily since then.
Last week, amid reports of an imminent Iranian attack, he again warned “don’t.”
Tehran’s answer? Some 300 airborne drones, missiles and rockets from Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Iran itself. Hezbollah fired an additional 30 rockets from Lebanon.
Iran read Biden correctly: Even after such blatant defiance, on Sunday he urged Israel to “pocket the win” and not retaliate, per a White House source. Indeed, US and Western officials reportedly want both Israel and Iran to feel victorious, as a way to deescalate.
Huh? Iran should feel victorious and not suffer reprisals? It’s beyond nuts — and utterly unrealistic.
After undermining Israel for months, Biden should be supporting Israel — no ifs, and or buts — in its response to Iran’s attacks.

Israel will figure out its response on its own, but no nation can let another let such a massive attack go unanswered, even if it manages to prevent great damage.
That would only greenlight more attacks.
 Since Oct. 7, Biden’s overriding goal has been to prevent escalation.
This weekend showed he’s failed spectacularly.
He mustn’t stick to the same policy, restraint and appeasement, that caused the failure.
There’s a word for doing so: insanity.

Jerusalem, undoubtedly, will strike back at Tehran. 
It likely will be big, loud and intended to reestablish Israeli deterrence in the Mideast.
But it must come with an endgame.
Iran is a target-rich environment for Israel Defense Forces planners — and Tehran is vulnerable to attack, particularly given Israel’s own extensive intercontinental-ballistic-missile arsenal and F-35 stealth fighter-bomber fleet.
Israel’s menu options are nearly endless. 

Iranian leadership, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps command and control, conventional military bases, air-defense systems, Iran’s oil export industry — and its nuclear-weapons program.

								US will not take part in any Israeli retaliatory action against Iran							










The last presents Jerusalem a very real and existential danger. 
All the more after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demonstrated Iran’s willingness to cross the Rubicon Saturday by attacking Israel directly.
Eliminating that threat is not an easy lift. 
Iran has 38 known nuclear-program facilities spread throughout a country only marginally smaller than the state of Alaska. 
Destroying Tehran’s emerging nuclear-weapons capacity will entail destroying centrifuge facilities at the Natanz and Fordow fuel-enrichment plants, where Iran is likely in the process of enriching uranium to a 90% weapons-grade level.

It also requires taking out numerous undeclared sites, ICBM production facilities, launch sites and existing stockpiles of weapon systems capable of carrying a nuclear payload and delivering it — including, potentially, Iranian submarines.
But will it be enough regardless of what the IDF hits?
Not likely.
Israel is going to climb the escalation ladder. 
But Jerusalem alongside Washington should consider a multilayered approach to eliminating Iran as a regional threat (and potentially a direct threat to America) rather than, as Team Biden prefers, simply appeasing it.
For decades, the West has ignored opportunities to exploit significant Iranian domestic opposition to the ayatollahs. 
President Barack Obama withheld support for the 2009 Green Movement, then ignored Iran’s declining influence after the early 2010s Arab Spring. 
And President Biden’s done the same as women bravely stand up to the suppression of women’s rights only to be brutally tortured and many murdered by Iran’s notorious “morality squads” or executed after sham trials.
Dissidents, women in particular, may be the secret sauce of smiting the ayatollahs — and realigning Iran into a representative democracy.

Israel’s security could, allegorically speaking, depend on the West’s ability to build an army of modern-day Iranian “Esthers.” 
Esther was the Jewish queen who foiled Haman’s sixth-century BCE plot to kill Persia’s Jews.
Washington has opted to ignore the repeated domestic waves of Iranian efforts to topple the mullahs. 
The Obama and Biden administrations instead looked to check Iran and its nuclear-weapons program by concentrating on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — in which America released more than $150 billion of Iranian frozen assets in hard US currency.

		How Israel defeated 99% of Iran missiles and drones — with the help of US and an unlikely ally	






Iran has used that money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and other IRGC-sponsored militias, including Yemen’s Houthis. 
Biden even considered lifting sanctions in 2021 if Tehran returned to the JCPOA. 
Removing the Houthis from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list was Biden’s first misstep in that direction.
Simply put, Khamenei and his mullahs need to go. Negotiating is no longer an option. 
Biden and Israel should recall the Trump administration’s “maximum-pressure campaign” against Iran helped fuel the domestic unrest that gave Iranian women a rare opening to begin protesting against the mullahs — a movement that quickly became countrywide.
To that end, as the IDF dials in its reprisal aims, Jerusalem should consider targets likely to destabilize Khamenei’s regime. 
Hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities and defense industries are the right strategic moves, but taking out the ayatollah’s domestic instruments of power might prove equally as valuable.
Israel’s David-versus-Goliath opportunity is at hand. 
Purposely striking Khamenei’s police forces, morality courts and other highly visible pressure points in Tehran and elsewhere could prove to be a slingshot-like force multiplier.
Especially if the United States recognizes the opening it’s likely to create — and begins actively aiding and funding Iranian dissidents to take on Khamenei at a grassroots level, while Israel’s militarily takes on Iran from high above.

Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Khamenei’s morality police murdered for not wearing a hijab properly, is Iran’s guiding star in waiting and the would-be face of its potential deliverance. 
Empowering her legacy by tapping into Iran’s dissidents might prove to be Israel and Washington’s ultimate endgame for Iran and its people’s own deliverance.

Saturday’s attacks on Israel created new questions about replenishing aid to war-torn Ukraine after months of tumultuous Republican infighting.
Iran’s unprecedented flurry of strikes on Israel sparked new urgency in Congress for additional military aid to the Jewish state as various Republican factions are seizing on the development to further their arguments on Ukraine.
Ukraine aid being taken up this week now appears to be a long shot.

“We’re stretched way too thin, [with] the number of weapon systems that we need, Ukraine needs, that Taiwan needs, that Israel needs. And we can’t do all of these things at once,” Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.

“When you’re stretched too thin, you’ve got to focus and you’ve got to rebuild your own country,” he went on. “Can we possibly fight all of those conflicts at once? No.”
Vance contended that the US should be encouraging Ukraine “to take a defensive posture” against the Russian invasion of their lands and place more focus on Israel instead.
In sharp contrast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seized on Iran’s brutal attack, calling it a “wake-up call” for the West.
“It is critical that the United States Congress make the necessary decisions to strengthen America’s allies at this critical time,” Zelensky pleaded.

Ukraine condemns Iran’s attack on Israel using “Shahed” drones and missiles.

A chorus of foreign policy luminaries within the GOP echoed that sentiment.
“These rockets and these drones are being bought by Russia, and they’re killing Ukrainians every day. What happened in Israel last night, happens in Ukraine every night,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) lamented to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
“The power grid is under threat right now. If the power grid goes out in Ukraine altogether, we don’t have time on our side here.”
McCaul noted that while “this is a speaker determination” as to when the House takes up a foreign aid bill for Ukraine, his “preference is this week.”

“Iran, Russia and China have engaged in an unholy alliance to undermine and destabilize the US, Israel and the free world,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) said after Iran’s attack.
“We must act decisively — Congress must pass aid to Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan.”
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-Ohio) stressed that the clock is ticking for Ukraine amid multiple setbacks on the battlefield to fend off the Russian invaders.
“Everyone has been very much on this side of understanding that we’re at a critical point. Russia is beginning to gain ground, Ukraine is beginning to lose the ability to defend itself,” Turner told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” 
“The United States must step up and provide Ukraine the weapons that they need, and I think we’re gonna see overwhelming support for that in the House this week.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was coy about the exact timeline he is pursuing regarding consideration of an aid package to Ukraine, but said Sunday that “we will send our package.”
The speaker specifically teased that he is contemplating bundling some of that assistance as a loan and tapping into seized Russian assets to fund the weaponry.
Back in February, the Senate passed a $95 billion supplemental package featuring some $14 billion for Israel and $60 billion for Ukraine. Johnson has declined to take that up for consideration. 
Democrats have clamored for him to do so.
“We didn’t need any reminders in terms of what’s going on in Ukraine,” White House national security spokesperson Kirby told NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “But last night certainly underscores significantly the threat that Israel faces in a very, very tough neighborhood.”
“We’re just looking for leadership out of the speaker’s office: get it on the floor, get it voted on so that not only Israel can get additional resources and defend itself — which they clearly need — but that Ukraine can as well,” he said, referring to the supplemental.

John Fetterman voiced some bewilderment at Republicans like JD Vance who oppose aid to Ukraine. J.C. Rice
Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.), who has emerged as one of the most prominent defenders of Israel within the Democratic Party, echoed that.
“We’re all in that same fight and we all need to stand with all these democracies. Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan as well, too,” Fetterman said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.
“It’s a disgrace if we don’t deliver this aid.”
President Joe Biden had requested Congress re-up aid to Ukraine back in August of last year, but the House of Representatives dragged its feet, mired by internal GOP bickering.
Republicans had sought to push the Biden administration into making concessions on the border in exchange for aid to Ukraine. However, the GOP later killed a $118 billion supplemental featuring both foreign aid and bolstered bordered security provisions.

Some still want the border addressed in exchange for Ukraine aid. 
“I am prepared to help Ukraine. I want to see us deal with the southern border too,” Rubio said on “State of the Union.” “I hope those two things can happen in conjunction.”
Looming over all of this is the specter of Johnson suffering a mutiny just like his predecessor Kevin McCarthy did last September.
Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has led the charge in threatening a motion to vacate the chair or oust him. She met with Johnson last week and refused to rule out the possibility of pulling the trigger on that motion afterward.
“How much money do the U.S. taxpayers have to pay now after this weekends [sic] Iranian activities? How much money will Zelenskyy get because obviously Ukraine first?” Greene grumbled on X.

Speaker Johnson visited Donald Trump as he stares down a rambunctious House GOP majority.  AP
Some Democrats have indicated they may toss him a lifeline this time if his ouster is predicated on Ukraine aid, though it’s not entirely clear how many.
Former President Donald Trump also broadly lent Johnson some words of support during their meeting in Mar-a-Lago last Friday, though not on Ukraine specifically.

A former top NATO commander Sunday derided the Biden administration as “timid” for not retaliating more against the Iran-backed terror group the Houthis, who have launched assaults against US warships.
Ex-NATO Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis — who served under President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president — criticized the White House over its handling of the defiant Yemeni rebels as the Israel-Hamas war threatened to spread with Iran’s air assault against Israel on Saturday.
“We have been too timid in our approach and striking back at the Houthis. They are proxies. They are creatures of Iran. We are trying to be very calibrated in our approach, and it’s not working,” said Stavridis, a 69-year-old former naval officer, to WABC 770 AM’s “Cats Roundtable” host John Catsimatidis.

President Biden needs to send a stronger message to America’s foes that it can’t be messed with, a former top NATO chief says. AP

“They are continuing to shoot at our warships. They are shooting at merchant traffic. Sooner or later, one of those ballistic missiles is going to get through, and you’re going to see dozens of American sailors killed, or big merchant ship sunk and environmental disaster or blocking the Suez Canal approaches,” Stavridis said.

The US struck hundreds of Houthi targets during a prolonged campaign earlier this year, but the terror group had been undeterred, killing three crew members of a Liberian-owned, Barbados-flagged bulk carrier just last month as it vowed to ramp up attacks during Ramadan.
On April 3, Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads US Air Forces Central, claimed the American attacks on the militia group have “certainly affected their behavior. Their pace of operations is not what it was.”
But Stavridis insisted that the US response to date is not enough.
“We need to increase the offensive work we’re doing against the Houthis,” he said.

“We’re going to probably have to start thinking about going after Iranian maritime targets to send them a signal to stop supplying these Houthi rebels. We have been too timid thus far in our approach against these pirates.  And that’s what they are. Every nation has an interest in this stopped.”
The Houthis took over vast swaths of Yemen in 2014, sparking a civil war. Their current offensives are aimed at supporting Palestinians during the Israel war after Oct. 7 while generally trying to increase their influence and popularity in the region.
Their ally, Iran, launched a blistering air attack on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a deadly assault on Iranian officials in Syria earlier this month. Still, nearly all of the drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted by Israel in the air.

Published 
April 14, 2024, 4:09 p.m. ET













The Biden administration is being blasted for allowing billions of dollars to allegedly flow into Iran under a controversial sanctions waiver — even after Iranian-backed rebels launched deadly air strikes against American forces and the Muslim country just directly attacked staunch US ally Israel.
Last month, the White House extended the waiver, a move that unlocked up to $10 billion more in frozen funds by enabling Iraq to pay the Iranian government for electricity services, according to critics and the Washington Free Beacon.
The Biden administration had already renewed the waiver program, which was established in 2018, in November. 
The extended waiver was then set to expire again in March, but the administration reapproved it once more — just six weeks after three US service members were killed and dozens more injured in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan in late January.
This past weekend, Iran launched 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an airstrike in Damascus earlier this month.

The State Department has long insisted such waivers are “necessary” while Iraq “weans itself off Iranian energy imports” and develops its domestic oil and gas production. The White House claims the unfrozen funds can only be used for humanitarian purposes.
“None of Iran’s money held in restricted accounts overseas has gone to Iran, and we have not freed up any cash to Iran. Any notion to the contrary is false and misleading.” the State Department told The Post in a statement Sunday. 
“That money is held in restricted accounts overseas with strict oversight and in close coordination between the Departments of Treasury and State.”

		The epic fail of Biden’s doctrine vs. Iran — no consequences	





Asked if plans are in the works to increase pressure on Iran through additional sanctions after Saturday’s missile strike, the State Department said, “We are in ongoing engagement with allies and partners, including at the G7, on ways to increase pressure on Iran, but we cannot preview or detail measures under consideration.”
In a statement to The Post, the White House stood by President Biden’s record on Iran, citing the US military’s efforts in thwarting last night’s attack, as well as imposing “more than 500 sanctions on Iran” since taking office.
“The waiver…which allows for Iraq to import Iranian energy as it works to become energy independent, continues a practice that was started by the Trump administration and has been renewed 21 times since 2018,” the White House said.
“Precisely zero money from this electricity waiver is going to Iran. U.S. sanctions remain in place and are continuing to prevent Iran’s money—whether from its oil sales under previous administrations or its electricity sales to Iraq that occurred—from flowing to Iran.”
“Under these waivers, no money has been permitted to enter Iran,” a State Department official insisted to the Beacon. “These funds, which are held abroad in third countries, can only be used for transactions for the purchase of food, agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, and other non-sanctionable transactions.
“The money goes straight to the trusted vendor or financial institution in another country. The money never touches Iran.”
But some Republican lawmakers say a lack of transparency and accountability has resulted in the funds being used to pay for state-sanctioned terrorist operations in the rogue nation.

Earlier this month, a group of 13 Republican senators led by Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Ranking Member Tim Scott (R-S.C.) wrote a pointed letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for an end to such sanction waivers.
The senators called it “unfathomable” that the Biden administration believes that making the funds potentially available to Iran serves US national security interests.
“If we want to actually restore deterrence in the region, those funds should be placed further out of Iran’s reach, not closer,” the blistering letter said.
On April 9, the committee grilled Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo about the “fungible nature” of the funds, which ostensibly are earmarked exclusively for humanitarian purposes.

Even Adeyemo said it is likely the funds have been used to finance “violent activity” before a cent of them reaches Iranians in need.
“What we’ve seen time and time again from the Iranian regime, is they [Iran] fail to feed their people, and they’ve put the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] first. Any dollar they have will go towards their violent activity before they deal with their people,” Adeyemo testified.
“That’s partially why almost none of the humanitarian money has been used for humanitarian purposes, because they don’t care about getting drugs and food for their people.”

In the wake of the Islamic republic’s missile and drone strike against Israel on Saturday, several of the letter’s signatories Sunday accused the Biden administration of emboldening the regime through its sanctions policies.
“President Biden’s hollow, dithering doctrine of appeasement has not only emboldened Iran, it’s enriched the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told The Post in a statement.
” ‘Don’t’ is not a foreign policy; and it’s certainly not a deterrent,” the senator said, referencing the one-word warning Biden issued ahead of Iran launching its attack.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told The Post that the Biden administration has overseen a flood of cash landing in Iran’s coffers.
“Four years ago, Iran was weak and the ayatollahs were nearly broke. Now thanks to Joe Biden’s sanctions relief and weak policies on Iran, they have enough cash to shoot 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unprecedented attack on our ally,” Cotton claimed.
Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby fended off questions about whether the administration has been tough enough on Iran.

“Look at the sanctions we’ve put in place against Iran, look at the resources we put into the region. It’s hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we’ve somehow go soft on Iran,” Kirby said.
He pointed the finger at former President Trump’s administration for Iran now being “dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before Mr. Trump was elected.”
On Saturday night, Iran launched 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles in a mass-scale aerial assault on the Jewish state.
With the help of Israel’s allies, and its advanced “David’s Sling” missile defense system, approximately 99% of the ordinance was intercepted and never hit the ground in Israel.

The Iranian general killed in the Israeli airstrike that triggered Iran’s retaliatory weekend attack was the Muslim country’s point-man on Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a report said Sunday.
The Coalition Council of Islamic Revolution Forces, an organization with close links to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi after his death for his “strategic role in forming and strengthening the resistance front as well as in planning and executing the Al-Aqsa Storm,” a k a the October massacre, according to the Jerusalem Post.
The group’s description of the slain officer April 3, two days after his death, marked the “clearest admission of Iran’s involvement in the atrocities which saw 1,200 mostly civilians murdered and over 250 taken hostage, since terror group Hamas invaded Israel on October 7,” said dissident news organization Iran International.

“This is essentially an official admission by a senior Iranian regime figure that Iran did indeed have a hand in the planning and execution of the October 7 attack,” the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute added.

Khamenei had denied Oct. 10 that Iran was involved in the October slaughter, although a Wall Street Journal report the next day said Tehran clearly had inside knowledge about the attacks, citing key sources within Iran and Hamas.

The airstrike led Iran to launch some 300 missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday night. 
The “vast majority” of the strikes were deflected by Israel, with the help of the US and other allies, officials said.

Iran — which hosted celebratory street rallies with banners supporting Hamas’ invasion on the same day of Oct. 7 massacre — was the site of similar scenes Sunday after Iran’s unsuccessful retaliatory barrage.

House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed to take another swing at passing an aid package to Israel this week in the wake of Iran’s unprecedented attacks against the US ally and dropped some hints about war-torn Ukraine.
“We have understood the urgency of this from the very beginning,” Johnson told Fox News’ “Morning with Maria.” “We passed our Israel support package [last year]. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk ever since, because we included a pay-for, as you remember.
“We’re going to try again this week,” he went on. “And the details of that package are being put together right now. We’re looking at the options on all these supplemental issues.”

Johnson (R-La.) previously pushed through a standalone package for Israel early on in his speakership, but it was never taken up by the Democrat-controlled Senate, whose leadership wanted that support paired with military assistance for Ukraine. Democrats also opposed proposed cuts to the IRS in that bill.

Back in February, the Senate passed a roughly $95 billion supplemental that allocated about $14 billion for Israel and $60 billion to Ukraine, but Johnson declined to take that up for a vote in the House of Representatives.

At the time, he cited concerns about the lack of border security reforms, though Republicans opposed a prior $118 billion supplemental that included provisions aimed at bolstering border security. 
In March, Johnson told The Post that it was important the House didn’t take up Ukraine aid before wrapping up the delicate appropriations process for fiscal year 2024, which Congress finished last month — six months late. 
Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has threatened to spark a motion to oust the speaker — as a warning that she could initiate a mutiny against him if he takes up Ukraine aid. Johnson has already roiled her on government surveillance and appropriations.

Johnson met with Greene last week and then later with Trump on Friday in Mar-a-Lago.
“[Trump’s] introduced the loan-lease concept, which is a really important one that I think has a lot of consensus, as well as these other ideas, the REPO Act, which we have discussed, which is seizing the assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to help pay for this resistance,” he said.
“We will put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.”

Trump lent Johnson his support, saying it’s “not an easy situation for any speaker” and that ” I think he’s doing a very good job.” The former president also sought to nudge Greene into being more understanding.
“He and I are 100% united on these big agenda items,” Johnson claimed. Green also bashed Johnson for not pushing harder against the Biden administration on border security.
“What Marjorie fails to notice is that we have been fighting on the border. We fight on it every day,” Johnson shot back, before contending that he prioritized averting a government shutdown to avoid the ripple effects on the border. 
“Imagine Border Patrol agents not being paid and those open borders, the responsibility for that being shifted to us. Imagine troops not being paid at this dangerous time. So that simply wasn’t an option for us, it would have reflected badly on us.”
Greene first dangled the motion to vacate just as the House of Representatives was wrapping up the appropriations process last month to stave off a government shutdown. After meeting with the speaker, she kept that option on the table. 
“That’s a distraction. What Marjorie’s done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because, if we don’t grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we’re going to lose the republic,” Johnson warned ominously.

		Sen. John Fetterman says Biden should not rule out US involvement in an Israeli campaign against Iran

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he didn’t agree with President Biden on his stance that the U.S. wouldn’t join in an offensive operation against Iran during an interview on Sunday, saying he would never “capitulate to the fringe” of his party.
CNN host Jake Tapper asked Fetterman to respond to reports that Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. wouldn’t participate in any offensive operations against Iran during a conversation on Saturday.
“Do you think that’s the right call or should direct U.S. military action, as some of your colleagues in the Senate are suggesting, should that be on the table?” he asked.
“I don’t agree with that, I just think we should follow and have Israel’s back in the situation. I don’t agree with the president. That doesn’t change anything that he‘s a fantastic president. I‘m proud to stand with him and campaign for him and vote for him,” he responded.

Tapper asked Fetterman to respond to Sen. Marco Rubio, who said the fact that the White House was leaking this information about the Biden-Netanyahu conversation was “offensive” to him because it signaled Biden was trying to “appease the far left in his party.”
“The president is entitled to his own views and whatever he decides to do. But I would never capitulate to the fringe. I’ll never pander to that as well. In fact, that empowers Hamas and Hamas, they’re actually convinced they’re winning the PR war. And they’re never going to negotiate at this point. They think that they’re going to hold onto the very end,” Fetterman said.



Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., stated that he does not agree with Biden’s position that he will not be joing Israel in a counter-offensive against Iran. AP
“And I know why they’re not willing to provide any kind of proof of life. And I don’t know why there’s not more of that conversation in the media, like what about the hostages? What’s happened to them? Where are they now? And let’s just bring them home. And then all of the harsh words should be directed at Hamas, which started this. And now continues to hold all of over 100 Israeli hostages,” he continued.
Fetterman argued Hamas could end the war today if they released the hostages.
As Iran launched a large wave of attack drones and missiles toward Israel on Saturday, the Israeli military was tracking and preparing to intercept the weapons in the first-ever direct attack on Israel by the Islamic Republic, the Times of Israel reported.



Despite not joining in the counter-offensive, Biden has promised to continue supporting Israel in other ways. AP
Earlier Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel had for weeks “been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran.”
Netanyahu said Israel’s “air defenses are deployed, we are ready for any scenario, both in attack and in defense,” Fox News Digital reported.
The White House vowed Saturday that the United States’ support for Israel’s security is “ironclad,” pledging to stand with the Jewish state and “support their defense” after Iran launched an aerial drone attack towards the country Saturday afternoon.

Fetterman was also asked in the interview if he was worried Trump could win Pennsylvania. The senator said it would be a close race.
“Trump, of course, he’s very popular here. I‘ve been saying that same thing eight years ago in 2016. And I was concerned and now, I’d like to point out that Joe Biden is the only American that ever beat Trump politically. And he’s going to do it again. And he’s going to carry Pennsylvania. And it‘s going to be close,” Fetterman said.
Fox News’ Stepheny Price and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

Nonplussed Israelis sunbathed and enjoyed outdoor cafes Sunday, hours after Iran’s air assault. 
About 99% of Iran’s drones and missiles were intercepted in the air by Israel with the help of US, Jordan, France and UK forces, leaving little structural damage — although they badly wounded an Arab child when the remnants of a shot-down ballistic missile fell on her family’s home near Arad, officials said.
The strikes — which were retaliation for Israel’s killing of seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fighters and leaders in Syria on April 1 — appeared to have left at least some Israelis relatively unphased, judging from photos published Sunday of people sunbathing in Tel Aviv and enjoying outdoor cafes.

“My husband went for for walk at 8.30, the cafés were open, the beach was open, Debbie Fenton told The Jewish Chronicle from Herzliya. “Everything was back to normal. Israelis are used to it. They’re used to being attacked; it’s normal life for them.”

Jerusalem resident Ayala Salant told Agence France-Presse that the “situation is really frightening” but added, “We are very, very happy with the alliance that helped us because most of the aircraft and missiles have not arrived to Israel.”
Lord David Wolfson shared on social media that his British parents had “no disruption at all” while staying in Jerusalem.

“Apparently there was a siren at 1 a.m., but we both slept through it. With double glazed windows, metal exterior blinds and fabric interior blinds, siren didn’t wake us up,” a message from his mother read.
“All quiet at the moment. Dad has been to the fruit shop. He has a lunchtime appointment at Maccabi to remove wax from his ears. Will get cabs both ways,” she added.
Shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange slipped less than 1% — a “slightly negative but not hysterical” reaction to the anticipated attack, IBI investment house chief economist Rafi Gozlan told the Times of Israel.
Still, many schools in Israel were slated to be closed Monday because of the active security threat, according to the outlet. Some ultra-Orthodox schools opened in defiance of the closures.
Parents of special-needs children attending the closed schools voiced their frustration, as they said they were expected to work despite the school closures.

“It’s so frustrating,” said Yulia Ben Moshe, 54, whose 16-year-old son is wheelchair-bound and dependent on a breathing apparatus, referring to the school closures that left her scrambling to find care.
“We are in a hard situation, but the system needs to plan for this. Every time something happens, families need to deal with it alone,” she said, adding, “This is a continuing problem during emergencies.”
Life was much slower to return to normal in Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack that left more than 1,200 dead.

A little more than six months later, Israel has reportedly killed more than 33,000 Palestinians and left millions more in a humanitarian crisis in its response.

President Biden met with G7 leaders in an emergency session Sunday after reportedly telling Israel that the US would not take part in a counterstrike after Iran’s drone attack — and Iranian and Israeli authorities prepared for their next moves.
“President Biden spoke by secure video with the leaders of the G7 today,” the White House wrote in a post on X above a photo of the commander in chief and his top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the meeting, with other heads of Group of Seven countries appearing on a video screen behind them. 
“The leaders condemned Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel and reaffirmed the G7’s commitment to Israel’s security,” the post said, referring to the group of leaders from global powerhouses including the US, UK, France and Japan.

Biden also privately spoke with Jordanian King Abdullah II about the “unprecedented” attack, the White House said.

The UN Security Council held an emergency session, too, in which US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood warned, “Let me be clear: If Iran or its proxies take actions against the US or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible.”

UN Secretary Genearl Antonio Guterres pleaded for calm.
“The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,” he said at the session.
Hawkish Israeli government ministers had reportedly called for an immediate retaliatory strike after Saturday night’s attack on Israel, which saw hundreds of drones and missiles launched into the Jewish nation. Most of the armed drones were intercepted in the air.
But those plans were shelved in favor of more talks — after a phone call between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the New York Times.
Biden warned Netanyahu during the call that the US would not take part in a counterstrike against Iran, a senior administration has said. 
Leaders around the world also swiftly issued statements condemning Iran’s actions but also expressing fears of a further escalation to the hostilities.

Biden also told Bibi “that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks — sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the White House said in a statement.
Israel’s war cabinet was meeting Sunday as the regional war threatened to create further global chaos.
Ahead of the meeting, Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz vowed that his country would take actions it deems appropriate in response to Iran’s aerial onslaught.

“We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” he said.
Biden convened a meeting of the G7 on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” officials said.

But in a saber-rattling statement, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi warned Israel and its allies against undertaking any “reckless behavior” in response to Saturday’s attack, during which approximately 99% of the 300 missiles and suicide drones were swatted down by Israel’s advanced “David’s Sling” air-defense system.
“If the Zionist regime or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response,” Raisi said in a statement Sunday.

But Iran may have overextended itself with Saturday night’s opening salvo.
Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, CENTCOM Chief Ret. Gen. Frank McKenzie said Iran’s attack “was close to a maximum effort as they could generate,” adding, “Iran could not replicate last night’s attack tonight if they had to…Iran is relatively weaker than it was yesterday.”
The US has not identified any credible threats to its own security at the moment, a Biden administration official told CNN.
Speaking on “Good Morning America” on Sunday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Israel “demonstrated a superior military capability” in fending off the airstrike but expressed concerns that their response could lead to the conflict spreading.

“We don’t want to see the situation escalate further, we’re not looking for a war with Iran,” Kirby said.
According to the Israel Defense Forces, Israel, along with its allies, thwarted Iran’s attack that included 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles with an approximately 99% interception rate.

		Oil prices expected to rise after Iran’s attack on Israel, but further gains may depend on response

Oil prices are expected to rise on Monday after Iran’s attack on Israel over the weekend, analysts said on Sunday, but further gains may depend on how Israel and the West choose to retaliate.
Iran launched explosive drones and missiles at Israel late on Saturday in retaliation for a suspected Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria on April 1, a first direct attack on Israeli territory that has stoked fears of a wider regional conflict.
Concern of a response from Iran to the strike on its embassy compound in Damascus supported oil last week and helped send global benchmark Brent crude on Friday to $92.18 a barrel, the highest since October.

It settled that day up 71 cents at $90.45, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude futures rose 64 cents to $85.66. Trading is closed on Sunday.

“It is only reasonable to expect stronger prices when trading resumes,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. “Having said that, there has been no impact on production so far and Iran has said that ‘the matter can be deemed concluded’.
“However fierce and painful the initial market reaction will be, the rally could prove to be short-lived unless supply from the region is materially disrupted.”

U.S. President Joe Biden said he would convene a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven major economies on Sunday to coordinate a diplomatic response to the Iranian attack.
“Oil prices might spike at the opening as this is the first time Iran has struck Israel from its territory,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
“How long any bounce will last will… depend on the Israeli response,” Staunovo added. “Also today’s G7 virtual meeting needs to be monitored, with an eye on if they target or not Iranian crude exports.”

Iran has steeply raised oil exports – its main sources of revenue – under the Joe Biden administration. Exports were severely reduced under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, who will face Biden in a presidential election rematch in November.
The Biden administration has argued it is not encouraging Iran to raise exports and is enforcing sanctions.
Lower Iranian exports would lead to a further rise in oil prices and the cost of gasoline in the U.S., a politically sensitive subject ahead of the elections.

Another factor to watch will be any impact on shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the volume of the world’s total oil consumption passes daily.
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s navy said on Tuesday Tehran could close the strait if deemed necessary, and earlier on Saturday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported a Guards helicopter had boarded and taken into Iranian waters a vessel, the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries.
“Crude prices already included a risk premium, and the extent to which it will widen further almost exclusively depends on developments near Iran around the Strait of Hormuz,” said Ole Hansen at Saxo Bank.

A Chicago politician was slammed by the Israeli consulate after she appeared to cheer Iran’s attack on Israel with a pro-Palestinian post — but later claimed she hadn’t seen the latest news when she made the post. 
Rossana Rodriguez, a councilwoman representing Chicago’s 33rd ward, posted “Free Palestine,” just hours after news began rolling in about Iran’s rocket attack Saturday on Israel.
Rodriguez, who has been outspoken about accusing Israel of genocide and demanding a ceasefire since the war in Gaza started following Hamas’ October 7 attack, quickly began facing flack over the post.

“We condemn in the strongest terms this Chicago Alderwoman’s celebration of Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel,” the Israeli consulate in the Windy City posted on X.

“This is the same Alderwoman behind the highly controversial ‘ceasefire’ resolution. We see a pattern – not aiming for peace, but for Israel’s destruction.”

Several hours later Rodriguez defended the timing of her post, claiming she’d just gotten off a flight and hadn’t seen the news when she made the post.
“I had just watched a video of Gaza with a father sobbing holding his dead child. This moment is immensely tragic and it’s sad that there’s people choosing to create so much more hate,” she wrote.
“I’ve been saying Free Palestine for decades & specially the last few months. I do not celebrate war or the loss of human life in any way,” she added, calling her critics the “same people who have been cheering on a genocide.”

The post came hours after Iran’s missile and suicide drone attack on Israel. X / @RossanaFor33
Rodriguez’s office didn’t immediately respond to request for comment Sunday.
Iran launched a barrage of about 300 suicide drones and missiles at the Jewish state on Saturday night — but miraculously, nearly all the weapons were shot down but defensive systems, according to Israeli media.
Only one casualty — a 7-year-old Bedouin girl — has been identified so far.

The missiles were launched from Iran, with Israeli air defenses — with the help of US , French, and UK ships and warplanes — shooting them out of the sky.

Fighter jets from Jordan also assisted, though the middle eastern country claimed it was not helping Israel but rather defending its own air space.

							AP						




Critics quickly pummeled President Biden over his response to the unprecedented escalation from Iran against Israel, blasting him for not addressing the public right away and being more supportive of the US ally. 
Biden, 81 pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against carrying out a retaliatory attack against Tehran amid fears of such actions spiraling into a larger war, according to multiple reports. 
This particularly animated his critics.

“I don’t agree with that,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I just think we should follow and have Israel’s back in the situation.”

“I don’t agree with the president. That doesn’t change anything that he’s a fantastic president, and I’m proud to stand with him and campaign for him and vote for him.”

Fetterman stressed that Biden is “entitled to his own views” but he insisted “I would never capitulate to the fringe.”
Like Biden, Fetterman has faced severe blowback from progressives for his support of Israel in its war against Hamas. Fetterman, however, has been unabashed about his pro-Israel stance.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) accused the administration of leaking Biden’s discussion with Netanyahu to the press in order to further pressure Israel against retaliation.

“Why would the White House leak it? There’s only one reason they leaked that, and that is that so when Israel does respond, the White House can say we told them not to do it,” Rubio told CNN.
Rubio further accused the White House of trying to “appease” his “far-left” base.
Former President Donald Trump’s ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton also recoiled at reports that Biden nudged Netanyahu against striking back at Iran.

“If Joe Biden as some press reports, have it, is urging the Israelis not to retaliate at all, he is an embarrassment to the United States,” Bolton told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“This is in America’s interest to make sure that Iran, which is the principal threat to international peace and security in the region, is at a minimum put in its place.”

The White House pushed back at criticism over Biden’s response and anyone questioning his commitment to Israel.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was coy about what Biden told Netanyahu during their call on Saturday in the wake of the salvo of Iranian attacks barrelling toward the Jewish state.
“The president has been a man of his word. He said we’re going to help Israel defend itself, and we’ve been doing that,” Kirby told CNN when asked if Biden was against Israel retaliating

Kirby also pointed out that the US intercepted dozens of drones and missiles before they reached Israeli airspace.
Kirby also shrugged off Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky) call on Biden to “match words with actions.”
“I don’t know how you can look at what happened and say that he hasn’t,” Kirby said.

President Biden met with his national security team to monitor Iran’s attack.  AP
The president also weathered blowback for his decision not to deliver public remarks on Saturday.
Biden, 81, had cut short his weekend beach trip to Delaware Saturday and bolted back to the White House ahead of the widely anticipated attack from Iran against Israel over the strike that killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi and deputy Gen. Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi earlier this month.
But not long after hundreds of Iranian missiles and explosive drones barreled toward Israel, the White House announced that Biden would have no more public events, and the president declined to deliver public remarks. 

As the American people watch in horror as Israel faces unprecedented attacks from Iran, Joe Biden and the White House shamefully called a lid and refused to address the nation and the world. Their silence is deafening. On the contrary, President Trump is scheduled to speak to…— Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) April 13, 2024

The announcement — “calling a lid,” in Beltway jargon — was made just after 5 p.m. Saturday. 
Behind the scenes, Biden directed the US response, holding a call with Netanyahu to congratulate him on an “incredible military achievement” by fending off the garage of Iranian attacks, according to Kirby.

The president also later put out a statement to “condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms,” directed the military to assist in the downing of Iranian weaponry, and announced plans to convene an emergency meeting of the Group of 7 leaders. 
Prominent Republicans and conservatives weren’t pleased.

I don’t care what political party you belong to, I think we can all agree that the leader of the free world should project strength, clarity and conviction.Biden couldn’t even speak yesterday as a major conflict that could lead to a world war broke out.We didn’t hear from him…— Joey Mannarino (@JoeyMannarinoUS) April 14, 2024

“Joe Biden and the White House shamefully called a lid and refused to address the nation and the world. Their silence is deafening,” House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said.
“On the contrary, President Trump is scheduled to speak to the American people in PA where I am certain he will make unequivocally clear that America stands with Israel and condemn Iran’s heinous attacks,” she added, referencing the former president’s planned rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.
“I don’t care what political party you belong to, I think we can all agree that the leader of the free world should project strength, clarity and conviction,” conservative commentator Joey Mannarino said.

If a Republican president went to his vacation home for the weekend knowing an attack on a major ally was all but certain, the mainstream media would be apoplectic and torching him as rudderless.But because it's a Democrat in Joe Biden, they won't speak up. They're cowards.— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) April 13, 2024

“Biden couldn’t even speak yesterday as a major conflict that could lead to a world war broke out. We didn’t hear from him at all. Any other President would have been out front and center leading the way and telling Iran to cut it out.”
“If a Republican president went to his vacation home for the weekend knowing an attack on a major ally was all but certain, the mainstream media would be apoplectic and torching him as rudderless,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck chided.
“But because it’s a Democrat in Joe Biden, they won’t speak up.”

Biden is weak and has dementia. Our adversaries do not respect us. This is the result. https://t.co/Fjq2Vesfo5— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) April 13, 2024

“Biden is weak and has dementia. Our adversaries do not respect us. This is the result,” OutKick founder Clay Travis said. 
Trump, 77, who presided over an escalation with Iran after he ordered a strike to kill Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, knocked his successor.

Iran carried out retaliatory strikes near US assets in the region afterward and Trump kept his powder dry in response.
“I want to say God bless the people of Israel — they’re under attack right now,” Trump declared at a Saturday rally in Schnecksville, Penn. “That’s because we show great weakness.”
“It would not have happened if we were in office.”

A plurality of Americans want President Biden to begin taking a tougher stance on Israel and want a cease-fire in the war against Hamas, a new poll found prior to Iran’s attack.
Thirty-four percent of respondents felt that Biden is “not tough enough” on Israel, while 17% felt he is too tough, 26% believe he is handling it just right, and 24% aren’t sure, per a Politico-Morning Consult poll.
Although taken before Tehran’s unprecedented military strike against Israel Saturday, the poll sheds light on the thorny politics Biden is grappling with domestically on Israel.

A plurality of voters want President Biden to toughen up on Israel, according to a new poll. AP
Democrats in particular were most likely to want Biden to toughen up on the critical US ally in the Middle East, with 33% feeling he is “not tough enough on Israel,” compared to 12% of Republicans and 19% of Independents.

A paltry 8% of Democrats felt Biden was “too tough” and 42% said that the president’s handling of the situation was “just right.”
Additionally, among the public writ large, 47% strongly support the US calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, while 20% somewhat support that call, 15% somewhat or strongly oppose it, and 17% are unsure.

Biden, 81, pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut a deal with Hamas for a cease-fire in exchange for hostages earlier this month. He wants a pause in fighting to send critical humanitarian aid to Gaza.
However, negotiations have repeatedly stalled amid heightened concerns over how many hostages are still alive. 
Still, despite the quibbling over how supportive of Israel Biden should be, a plurality of Americans favor the Israelis in the conflict, the survey revealed.

When asked about whom they were more sympathetic toward, 29% of respondents said Israel, 14% the Palestinians, 37% equally both sides, and 20% said they don’t know. 
Among Democrats, 22% were more sympathetic toward the Palestinians, 16% the Israelis, while 44% said both.

Meanwhile, Republicans sided with the Israelis over the Palestinians by a 45% to 7% margin, while Independents hewed that way 25% to 13%.
On whether the US should cut off aid to Israel, 41% of Democrats support doing so while 33% were opposed, compared to 33% of Americans overall in favor of cutting off aid and 44% in opposition.

That poll was conducted from April 5 to 7 among 6,004 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point for the overall group surveyed. 
Separately, a CBS YouGov poll found a growing number of Americans want Biden to push Israel to ease up its military campaign in the war against Hamas.

When asked about what Biden should encourage Israel to do, 37% said cease military actions and 23% said decrease military actions; surpassing the 28% who want Biden to push Israel to maintain the current level of action and 12% who want an increase. 
That’s an uptick from the 31% who want Biden to push for a stop to its military actions and 24% who want a decrease in military actions; compared to the 32% who want Biden to push Israel to keep up the same level of actions and 13% who want an increase back in February.

In terms of sympathies, 32% said they sympathize “a lot” with the Israelis, while 46% said the same about the Palestinians.
That’s a sharp reversal from October, when 44% said their sympathies lie with the Israelis and 39% with the Palestinians, according to the CBS poll. 
Like Politico, the CBS poll was conducted prior to Iran’s historically unprecedented strike against Israel.

President Biden is facing intense pressure from his base over the Israel-Hamas war. AP
When presented with the hypothetical of Iran attacking Israel, 25% backed military action against Iran, 42% wanted the US to support Israel’s actions without getting involved militarily, and 32% wanted the US to stay out of it. 
The CBS poll was taken from April 9 to 12 among 2,399 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan on Sunday described how he was forced to take shelter in Bethlehem during Iran’s attack on Israel — hours before meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.
“This Sunday in Bethlehem all does seem calm and bright. And it is for us. We feel safe and secure. That wasn’t true in the middle of last night when the air raid sirens went off, and we had to go down and seek security at Notre Dame Center.” the New York cardinal said in a video shared on X, referencing the Christmas song “Silent Night.”

“But right now things look good, and we’re grateful for that,” he added.

He later met with Abbas in the presidential headquarters in Ramallah, about 6 miles north of Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.

During their meeting, Abbas told the cardinal that he appreciated the Church’s “positions calling for stopping the Israeli aggression and achieving peace and stability in the Holy Lands and the world,” the outlet said.  
Dolan, in return, reportedly conveyed the pope’s greetings and praised Abbas’s “role and wise leadership in enabling the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights supported by the Catholic Church,” according to WAFA.

Dolan is set to remain in Israel and Palestinian-controlled territories through Thursday as part of his role as chair of the Catholic Near East Welfare Association, according to an earlier press release.
He is meeting with local Christian, Jewish and Islamic religious leaders — as well as hopefully spending time with the families of hostages, the statement said.

Dolan also noted in his statement that he’ll “enjoy a Sabbath meal with Jewish friends and visit with Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups.”

His visit comes as Iran launched a slew of deadly drones at Israel on Saturday evening that killed a 7-year-old Bedouin girl.
The move comes in retaliation after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
In Sunday’s video, Dolan notes before the attack Saturday night that he visited the Creche — a center in Bethlehem run by nuns who take in abandoned babies.
 “Those are messages of inspiration that you get here in the Holy Land that I think have given the people the resilience and hope for which they are famous. Happy Sunday,” Dolan said, concluding the video.

Iran fired some 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles at Israel, but 99% of them had been shot down by Israel, according to a military spokesperson.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the outcome was a “very significant strategic success” and President Biden said the US helped its ally down “nearly all” of the airstrikes.

Russia said on Sunday it was extremely concerned by Iranian strikes on Israel and called on all parties to exercise restraint but said tensions would remain high until the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was resolved.
“We express our extreme concern over another dangerous escalation in the region,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the Iranian attacks. “We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint.”
Russia noted that Tehran had said the attack was made within the right to self-defense after Israel’s strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that Moscow condemned.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that a war between Israel and Iran would worsen Joe Biden’s prospects of being re-elected US president. AP

Russia, which has close ties to Iran, said that the West had blocked attempts in the United Nations Security Council to respond to the Israeli strike on the consulate.

“We have repeatedly warned that the numerous unresolved crises in the Middle East, primarily in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone, which are often fueled by irresponsible provocative actions, will lead to an increase in tension,” the ministry said.
The Kremlin has yet to comment publicly.

But Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that a war between Israel and Iran would worsen Joe Biden’s prospects of being re-elected US president.

“America does not want a big war in the Middle East,” Medvedev said on Telegram. “The killings in Gaza worsen Biden’s prospects in the elections, and war between Israel and Iran would introduce additional uncertainty.”

President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister that nothing of “value” was hit in Iran’s airborne attack Saturday and asserted American forces will not be participating in any offensive against Iran, according to a report.
The president called Israel’s defense during the attacks a win — telling Netanyahu Israel’s ability to intercept nearly all of the hundreds of missiles and drones showed its military superiority, a US official told CNN. 
Biden also made it very clear that the US would not be engaging in any military offensive against the Islamic Republic, the senior official told the channel
Israeli Defense Forces said it had shot down the “vast majority” of projectiles outside of Israel’s borders. It was assisted by the US military.

“At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night after his phone call with the Israeli leader, according to readout of the call released by the White House.
“Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” he added.

A handful of missiles made it through, with one striking an Israeli base, but damages were minor and no injuries were reported, according to IDF officials.
A senior US official told CNN that the US forces intercepted more than 70 drones and at least three ballistic missiles. The missiles were shot down by two guided missile destroyers deployed in the eastern Mediterranean.
US fighter jets also helped defend Israel from the barrage, another official told the outlet.

Biden said he will meet with G7 leaders on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.”
“While we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” the president said.

Jewish New Yorkers were shocked and outraged by Iran’s missile attack on Israel Saturday, leaving many fearing for their loved ones trapped in the besieged Jewish State.
“Of course, I’m scared for my family and their well-being,” Chaim Goldstein told The Post as he left Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters in Crown Heights.
The Post broke the news of the invasion to dozens of worshippers who had not heard what happened because of Sabbath restrictions.

One man sprinted across the busy Eastern Parkway upon hearing the news so he could check on his family in Israel.

A police presence was stationed outside the synagogue as a precaution.

“I just pray that Hashem should take care of the Jewish people and that the hostages should be allowed to return to their home,” Rabbi David Sholom Pape, 79, told The Post, describing Iran’s attack as a “suicide mission.”
““This is obviously something that could involve the whole world. If they’re stupid enough to do that, they’d commit suicide. They promised they’d do such and such so they had to do something or they’re just straw men. It may just be for show.”

Despite having no knowledge of the escalation, several were unsurprised upon learning that Iran deployed hundreds of suicide drones, ballistic missiles and rockets at the Jewish state in a middle-of-the-night attack.
The strike with some 200 drones marks Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel and comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.

“I’m not surprised but it’s getting serious,” 26-year-old Samson said, noting that his entire family lives in Israel.
“We call every day to find out how they’re doing. We pray every day for our brothers and sisters in their holy land.”
Samson, who declined to provide his last name, chastised the Iranians in Tehran who were seen in photographs celebrating the destruction.
“It’s horrible,” he said. “Celebrating genocide is horrible.”

Samson, a 26-year-old Brooklynite, said he wasn’t surprised Iran escalated the tension between itself and Israel. Paul Martinka
“We don’t dance around when there are missiles dropping everywhere.  War is terrible. War is cruel. We want the war to stop. Anyone dancing anywhere for missiles dropping is cruel.”
Moshe Frank, 38, agreed — claiming that the Iranian people have been “brainwashed to hate Israel.”
“I’m not sure what they’re celebrating about,” the Brooklynite said. “I hope there’s no more escalation.”

Goldstein, 18, moved to Crown Heights from Israel for school in September — just one month before Hamas launched its Oct. 7 surprise attack that kickstarted the Middle Eastern war.
With his mother’s family still living in Israel, Goldstein pushed for peace and for the conflict over the Jewish State to end.
“I think they also believe it should stop, the missiles and the war,” he said of his family. “We should live in peace together, just like the Arabs and Jews lived in peace,” he said.

In spite of the destruction, Rabbi Shimmy Weinbaum, 49, stressed that God would save the people of Israel — just as he had when Iraq initiated a missile campaign against Israel in 1991.
“The same God who protected us then is still around. He didn’t go anywhere and he will protect us,” Weinbaum said.
The rabbi’s 18-year-old daughter had coincidentally traveled from Israel to Crown Heights to celebrate Passover with her father.

The move marks Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel and comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.

Weinbaum appeared unafraid about the prospect of her return, stating that he feels “like she’s more protected in Israel than she is here.”

Mayor Eric Adams emphasized that New York City “unequivocally stands with the State of Israel” as it faces fresh attacks from Iran.
“As mayor of the largest Jewish population in the world outside of Israel, the significance of this attack for Jewish New Yorkers — many of whom have family in Israel right now — is not lost on me, especially less than 10 days before Passover begins,” Hizzoner said in a statement.
“While there is no direct or imminent threat to New York City at this time, we have directed the NYPD to deploy additional resources to Jewish communities and houses of worship citywide out of abundance of caution to ensure that our communities have the resources they need to feel safe.”
Jewish leaders across New York took to social media to condemn the offense Saturday, including Sen. Chuck Schumer.

“As Israel is under attack from Iran, we stand with Israel and its people, and the United States will do everything we can to support Israel’s defense against Iran,” Schumer said on X.
Mark Treyger, south Brooklyn’s former Democratic city councilmember and Jewish caucus member, said the attack on the Jewish state was a “sobering reminder” of Israel’s suffering since the outbreak of the war on Oct. 7.

“Through proxies, the Iranian unelected, autocratic, regime attacks Israeli civilian populations (Christians, Jews, and Muslims) almost every single day, including contributing to the October 7th massacre via their support for Hamas,” he tweeted. 
“Tonight, the autocratic regime launched an unprecedented and significant direct attack on a U.S. ally and the only democracy in the region. Very thankful for the United States’ armed forces support for our ally in this turning point moment in world history.”

					Iran's leader Ali Khamenei launched a direct attack Saturday against Israel.						
							ZUMAPRESS.com						




After years of using its terrorist proxies to strike Israelis, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei launched a direct attack Saturday against the Jewish state. More than 200 kamikaze drones, weaponized drones and ballistic and cruise missiles were fired from Iranian soil as well as from proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, as Israel and the United States mobilized military assets to intercept them before they struck their targets.
For Iran’s normally cautious supreme leader, this was a risky step. By crossing a red line of a direct attack against Israel from Iranian soil, he opened the door for Jerusalem to hit back hard.
Potential targets include leadership and military assets inside Iran, oil refineries, which are the lifeblood of his regime, and his rapidly expanding nuclear weapons program.
Khamenei may have thought he had little choice. In a daring April 1 operation, the Israeli Air Force killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who played a central role in the planning and execution of Iran’s proxy Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. That savage strike killed 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, including more than 30 Americans, and led to the kidnapping of more than 240 hostages. The IAF killed Zahedi, another top IRGC general and five other IRGC commanders who were planning operations in an IRGC-Quds Force building adjacent to Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria.
Trained terrorists
Zahedi was a big fish. He led the IRGC’s operations out of Syria and, as the main Iranian contact with Lebanese Hezbollah, had helped arm and train Iran’s most dangerous terrorist army.

Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with the Israel Defense Forces for the past six months and possesses more than 175,000 missiles, rockets and mortars including deadly precision-guided munitions that could do devastating damage to Israeli civilian infrastructure.



A map detailing Iran and its proxies strike on Israel.
Not for nothing did Israel see the killing of Zahedi as the most consequential since the Trump administration — with detailed intelligence provided by Israel’s Mossad spy agency — killed Qassem Soleimani, the feared IRGC Quds Force commander, who had waged war against the United States and Israel for decades.
Khamenei took no heed of the Friday warning from President Biden, who told the Iranians “Don’t!” when asked what his response would be to an Iranian attack. The president had dispatched US Central Command Gen. Michael Kurilla to Israel to meet with his IDF counterparts and sent a US warship up the Red Sea. None of this seemed sufficient to deter an Iranian attack though it may have mitigated its severity.

Follow along for live updates on Iran’s attack on Israel 

Now the Biden administration must do more by providing Israel with ballistic-missile-defense support as the two forces have practiced for decades. Washington also should provide all the military supplies the IDF needs to respond to this aggression and unwavering political support to see Israel through this critical time.
Biden’s wavering support for Israel in its war against Hamas, and the threat from dozens of Democratic members of Congress to cut off military support, surely emboldened Khamenei.

Israel is a formidable military power with extensive military assets. It has a multilayered air-defense system that can shoot down drones and cruise and ballistic missiles. But the IDF cannot only play defense. It will be under pressure to respond directly to Iranian aggression with its powerful air, naval and cyber capabilities. If not, this could normalize Iranian direct attacks against Israel. This may also be an opportunity to attack assets connected to Iran’s rapidly expanding nuclear-weapons program.
The Islamic Republic has been at war with Israel for decades. But Iran’s supreme leader now has crossed an Israeli red line that he may come to regret.

A Middle East expert warned that Iran’s aerial strike targeting Israel has the potential to drag Jerusalem into a multi-front war.
“Everyone is talking about Iran, but what’s Hezbollah going to do?” Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, told The Post, referring to the southern Lebanon-based terror group.
“Israel could face attacks on two fronts.”
A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies warned that with Hezbollah, Israel would face a “far more formidable” enemy than the Palestinian terror group Hamas, whom the Jewish state has been engaged in a six-month war following the Oct. 7 attacks.

One major concern is Hezbollah’s arsenal of more than 130,000 rockets and missiles, which have a range covering all of Israel, that the terror group has received from Iran, Hoffman noted.
“The only reason [Hezbollah] has a missile arsenal provided by Iran is for this eventuality: If Iran is attacked by Israel, Hezbollah would exact terrible retaliation.”

Follow along for live updates on Iran’s attack on Israel 

Iran launched its first-ever attack on Israel Saturday, with approximately 500 drones and missiles coming from the Islamic Republic, according to US officials.
Photos show objects being shot down in Israel’s skyline, with objects exploding in the sky.

In response to attack, Iranians went to the streets to celebrate.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the country while the country was preparing for a direct attack.

He said the Jewish state will respond accordingly.
“Our defense systems are deployed, and we are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense. The State of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, the public is strong.”

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group — the former and possibly future president’s eponymous social-media company — have lost around half their value since going public last month. 
It’s easy to see why: Massive operating losses — and let’s face it, aside from Trump himself, just who really uses its Truth ­Social social-media product? 
User traffic on the platform is just a small fraction of its major competitor X (formerly known as Twitter, whose owner Elon Musk continues to pull out his hair trying to figure out how to make his baby profitable nearly two years after taking it private). 
And yet with all the selling, Trump Media shares aren’t worth zero — far from it in fact (it closed Friday at $32.59, down from its high of $79.38). 

So someone must be buying the stock that trades under the symbol “DJT,” which in case you don’t know, are the initials for the one-and-only, Donald J. Trump.

The question is, who is crazy enough to throw money at a business that reported big losses, is warning of potential insolvency, and offers investors a stock likely to fall a lot further? 
It’s a question I’ve been posing to my friends in the market-making business (people who match buyers and sellers of stock), and some random traders, and the answers aren’t that crazy if you understand how markets work, and how they’ve evolved in recent years. 
Some of the buying is irrational, and some of it makes all the sense in the world if you work at a major trading desk and are willing to roll the dice to make a quick buck. 
Let’s start with the irrational. 
The most natural buyers are the true believers — so-called meme investors who flooded the markets in recent years — and now see DJT (despite its suspect business model) as their next get-rich-quick scheme. 
Meme investors are indeed an odd bunch. 
They seem to think stock prices never go down and that tapping into a social-media “meme” — like a company backed by a celebrity ex-president who is fighting off multiple indictments yet remains ahead in the polls — will make them a fortune. 
Yes, we’ve seen this before. 
Recall how a couple of years ago first-time investors flocked to shares of GameStop, trading under the symbol GME, and AMC Theatres, thinking they found gold in beaten-down shares of financially troubled companies. 
Initially they made some money as they bid up share prices, though many were part of the HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) social-media investing craze who thought that via some magic, these companies would suddenly transform themselves into the next Apple or Amazon. 
Cold hard reality 
They didn’t of course. 
GME hit some highs, and traders who shorted the stock (betting it would fall) initially got crushed, but soon enough, reality set in. 
Same with AMC. 
GME now is down more than 50% over the past year and AMC more than 90%. 
And after factoring in its reverse split, its stock is worth just about 27 cents to long-time holders. 
Shorts eventually made a fortune. 
The meme scenario is playing out once again in the trading of DJT, and that accounts for the other buyers of DJT: stock lenders. 
DJT is a perfect short for reasons outlined above. But the process of short selling involves borrowing shares for a fee, holding them, and hopefully making money by replacing the borrow when shares decline.
Yet to short something, you must find shares to borrow, aka someone to lend them to you. 
After the initial meme rally, there was plenty of AMC and GME in circulation.

DJT shares are pretty scarce, I am told, because insiders like Trump can’t sell for six months thanks to lockups that kick in after a public offering. 
The float is far less than half of DJT’s outstanding shares, so it costs a lot of money to borrow the stock. 
The financial-data firm S3 Partners says DJT is among the most expensive stocks to borrow in the market. 
In other words, there’s some money to be made in lending the stock, and that accounts for the other set of DJT’s buyers in recent weeks, traders tell me. 
Of course, this is all tricky business; any trader who is lending stock owns it, so he needs to hedge by shorting other shares. 
Even so, if prices of DJT decline significantly and the hedges don’t work out, that might cost him more money than what he’s earning from lending fees. 
But stock trading isn’t for the faint of heart. 
There are lots of reasons why people buy something and, given the intricacies of the market, there are lots of ways they can earn a dollar from spending a dime. 
Iran and the Fed 
The latest inflation numbers might stop the Fed from cutting rates in June, though a bigger concern for those banking on the return of easy money might be what’s coming out of the Middle East. 
Wall Street traders told me late last week the word they were getting from government sources was that an Iranian response to Israel’s missile strike on Iran’s Syrian embassy was imminent. And Iranian drone attacks were underway as this column went to press. If the situation escalates, watch oil prices soar, inflation spike —  and forget about rate cuts for the foreseeable future.
If the situation escalates, watch oil prices soar, inflation spike — and forget about rate cuts for the foreseeable future. 

Unrest and war, particularly in the Middle East, is never a good thing, but the volatility of this one could be immense given the economic stakes of higher oil prices. 
Not only will the Fed’s rate-cut plans be shattered, the economy could take a nosedive, upending the 2024 presidential race. 
So stay tuned.

Iran launched a volley of drones and missiles at Israel that are expected to strike the Jewish homeland in several hours, according to US and Israeli officials.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told CNN that GPS will not be available in some areas to track the drones as they prepare defenses against the imminent attack.
Iran has a massive arsenal of its deadly ‘suicide” drone, the Shahed 136.
Unverified footage posted on social media by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-linked accounts purportedly shows the buzzing sound of Shahed drones flying over Iraq.

Iran sold thousands of these weapons to Russia that were subsequently used against targets in the Ukraine, according to Haaretz. 
Iran has also provided them to Houthi rebels in Yemen.
The kamikaze drones have a range of more than 1,500 miles and can carry 80-pound warheads, according to ArmyTechnology.com.

They are capable of flying for up to 24 hours with loads as large as 660 pounds.
The IDF said it is tracking at least 100 drones.

Israel has a number of layers of air defense capable of intercepting everything from long-range missiles to UAV’s and short-range rockets. 
Hagari said Israel has an “excellent air defense system” but stressed it is not 100% effective and urged the public to listen to safety announcements.
US officials said they will attempt to intercept launches at Israel if possible, CNN reported.

Iran is prepared to retaliate if Israel launches a counter-attack following drone and missile strikes on Saturday, Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,” Iravani wrote in a letter to UN leadership on Saturday, according to Newsweek.
Iravani explained that Iran “does not seek escalation or conflict in the region” and that the drone attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Damascus, Syria, on April 1, which killed two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, including Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi.




“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,” Iraveni said.

“Should the Israeli regime commit any military aggression again, Iran’s response will assuredly and decisively be stronger and more resolute.”

Meanwhile, a 7-year-old Israeli girl from Southern Israel has been severely injured by Iran’s drone and missile onslaught on the Jewish state, per Israel’s emergency service.
The girl is being treated for her injuries by medics from the Magen David ambulance services after she was struck by shrapnel.
The MDA said in a statement that the child suffered a head injury and was rendered unconscious.
Iran has launched a wave of hundreds of drones, as well as cruise missiles at Israel.
The move comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
Israel has instituted restrictions on civilian activity in response to the strike.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “We are prepared for any scenario.”

Israel shot down the “vast majority” of drones and missiles shot at them by Iran after the Jewish state was attacked in a vicious Saturday barrage, officials said.
Iran launched some 300 drones and missiles from within the Islamic Republic — as well as from proxies in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon.
The “vast majority” of the missiles were intercepted outside of Israeli air space, the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement.

Little damage was reported. One Israeli military base suffered minor damage and one child was hurt by drone shrapnel.

								Hooray for Israel! Now Biden should back Israel’s  response vs. Iran — no ifs, ands or buts							










Nothing of “value” was hit in Israel, President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CNN reported, citing White House sources. 
“We intercepted, we repelled, together we shall win,” Netanyahu posted on X early Sunday.
Israel Defense Forces Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told The Associated Press, meanwhile: “A wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation.”

Israel has instituted special measures in response to the strikes.  x @Toxicity_______
When asked whether Israel would respond, Hagari responded that the army “does and will do whatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel.”
A few missiles managed to get through Israeli defenses, he said. Israeli emergency officials confirmed that one strike critically wounded a 7-year-old girl in southern Israel.
But there were no casualties as a direct result of the Iranian strike, according to Magen David Adom [MDA], Israel’s emergency service agency.
Earlier, MDA said a 7-year-old girl was severely injured in southern Israel by shrapnel from an interceptor missile during Iran’s attack.

The agency said it responded to 31 people who were injured seeking shelter or suffering from anxiety.
Another missile struck an army base, causing some damage but no injuries were reported, Hagari said.
US military forces shot down an undisclosed number of Iranian drones, according to officials.
“In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, US forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched drones targeting Israel,” the official told CNN.
Hours after Iran’s attack, the IDF’s Home Front command told Israelis nationwide no longer need to stay near protected rooms — but that restrictions on gatherings announced earlier would remain in effect, The Times of Israel reported. All educational activities have also been canceled.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations suggested in a statement that the retaliatory strikes may be over — and warned the US to stay out of any engagements between Iran and Israel.
“The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe.
It is Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel, and photos emerged Saturday night of Iranians celebrating in Tehran.  
The attacks followed weeks of threats from Tehran after the assassination in Damascus of a top Islamic Revolutionary Guard general that has been widely blamed on Israel.

Jordan’s air force intercepted and shot down dozens of Iranian drones that violated its airspace and were heading to Israel, two regional security sources told Reuters.
The United Kingdom has reportedly not deployed any military resources to intercept Iranian drones but was providing backfill for US assets that have been redeployed after Iran’s attack, CNN reported.
Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group, announced they fired dozens of rockets from southern Lebanon toward Israel.

Israeli officials said they believe the attacks were aimed primarily at Israeli military targets. US officials told CNN that American forces were not targeted.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement after the drones were launched, declaring, “The malicious Zionist regime will be punished.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation shortly before the attacks and said the country was prepared for a direct attack and will respond accordingly.
“Citizens of Israel, in recent years, and even more so in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran,” Netanyahu said.





“Our defense systems are deployed, and we are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense,” he declared. “The State of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, the public is strong.”
Iran says it will not hesitate to take further “defensive measures” to protect its interests against any military aggression, the Iranian foreign ministry says in a statement.
“Iran, if necessary, will not hesitate to take further defensive measures to safeguard its legitimate interests against any military aggressions and unlawful use of force,” it says, according to state TV, “while reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed the nation. 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned “the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran this evening.”
“I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war,” he said in a statement.

Footage showing the drones and missiles crossing the night sky was widely shared on social media.
President Joe Biden rushed back to the White House on Saturday evening from his weekend beach getaway in Delaware for an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the attack.
The president spoke with Netanyahu on the phone, CNN reported.

Biden again said in the face of Iran’s threats that his commitment to Israel’s security is “ironclad” — a change from the harsh criticism voiced in recent weeks over the war in Gaza.
Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said any direct hit by Iranian drones on Israeli soil “will probably” elicit a response ten-fold.

“If Israel is hit and is hit in a sensitive location, Israel will respond heavily,” he said. He said Iran launching drone strikes “is obviously a significant escalation. There’s no other way to put this.” 
Schanzer said in theory there’s “very little” difference between Iran directly attacking Israel versus directly conducting a strike on Jerusalem, but that the optics of a direct launch from Tehran “gives Israel an opportunity now to turn the tables on the regime.”

“The Iranians can no longer claim to be the aggrieved party. It’s a direct strike after having coordinated literally thousands of strikes from proxies. This is a moment that I would say has been inevitable in the region for several decades now, where the regime is finally owning its own aggression and it will give the Israelis ample opportunity to respond.”
Schanzer noted though that if Israel manages to take out “95 to 95%” of Iran’s drones in Saturday’s strike “that may be the end of it,” or may choose to retaliate at some later point.  
“They’ll have the time and space to decide to do so. so much depends on how successful these drone strikes are when anticipating a response.”

Published 
April 13, 2024, 3:18 p.m. ET













The body of a missing Israeli teen shepherd was found in the West Bank Saturday morning, and officials are treating the killing as a terror attack.
Benjamin Achimeir, 14, was last seen leaving the settlement of Malachei Shalom early Friday, Israeli media reported. The sheep he was shepherding later returned without him.
His body was spotted by a drone on Saturday. The teen is believed to have been shot, but that report has not been confirmed.

The Israeli army has classified the killing as a “terrorist attack.”

No one group immediately claimed responsibility for the murder.

“We will get to the murderers and their helpers as we do to anyone who harms the citizens of the state of Israel,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday.
He ordered the Israel Defense Forces, Shin Bet and Israel Police to conduct a wide-scale intelligence and operational probe into the Palestinian villages near where the boy was found, the Jerusalem Post reported.

Achimeir’s vanishing sparked a wave of settler violence against the Palestinian village of al-Mughayyir.
During Friday’s outcry, 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia was killed and 25 others were reportedly wounded, according to Palestinian health officials.
Dozens of settlers returned to the village following the discovery of the teen’s body Saturday and burned 12 homes and several cars, according to reports.

Three more people in the village were injured, one critically, health officials said.
In the nearby village of Douma, Israeli settlers set fire to about 15 homes and 10 farms, the head of the village council, Slieman Dawabsheh, said.
The Israeli army used tear gas and rubber bullets against the villagers, he claimed.

Tensions between settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank — which is claimed as Palestinian territory, though it has been occupied by Israel since 1967— have run particularly high since the Oct. 7 terror attack.
While the Hamas terror group fends off an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, its allies are also reportedly trying to ignite a second front in the West Bank.

According to the Associated Press, over 460 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli gunfire over the past six months.

The fallout from Binyamin Achimeir’s death comes as Israel braces for a seemingly imminent direct attack from Iran, which has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike earlier this month that killed a Revolutionary Guards leader.
The IRGC has already commandeered a Portuguese-flagged, Israeli-linked ship near the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Israeli-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz in the latest escalation of the simmering standoff between the two countries.
An unverified video of the incident first obtained by the Associated Press showed IRGC commandos rappelling onto the MSC Aries vessel, the Times of Israel reported.
“Don’t come out,” a crew member on the ship can be heard saying in the footage, which was also posted on X by Times of Israel reporter Mannie Fabian.

The crew member can then be heard telling another to head to the ship’s bridge, as more IRGC commanders were rappelling onto the desk.

One commando is seen kneeling over the others to protect them from potential cover fire, the Times of Israel reported.

								Wild video shows leftwing activists in Chicago chant ‘death to Israel, death to America’ in Farsi							









 



								US will not take part in any Israeli retaliatory action against Iran							










The seized ship is a Portuguese-flagged vessel affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a London-based outfit of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group, the outlet explained.
Portuguese authorities are in contact with Iran about the seizure, Portugal’s government told CNN.
None of the sailors are believed to be Portuguese, the outlet said.
There are believed to be about 25 crew on board, CNN added, citing the Mediterranean Shipping Company.
The MSC Aries was last located off Dubai and headed for the Strait of Hormuz on Friday.
The ship then turned off its tracking data, which is common practice for Israeli-affiliated vessels in the region, the Times of Israel reported.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations had earlier reported a ship seizure near the Strait of Hormuz, but could only confirm that “regional authorities” were responsible, CNN said.
Iran’s Tasnim and IRNA state news agencies both appeared to confirm that the IRGC was involved in the incident, the Times of Israel and CNN reported, respectively.

The IRGC has directed the ship “back to Iranian territorial waters,” according to IRNA.
“The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have seized a Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,” Israel’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz wrote on X Saturday.
“The Ayatollah regime of…is a criminal regime that supports Hamas’ crimes and is now conducting a pirate operation in violation of international law,” he added.
Katz demanded that the European Union and the “free world” declare the IRGC a “terrorist organization” and impose sanctions on Iran.
Israel is currently on high alert for a direct attack from Tehran, which is expected to avenge an April 1 strike that killed seven Iranian military officers “sooner than later,” according to US officials.
Any direct conflict between Israel and Iran threatens to turn Israel’s war against Tehran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip into a region-wide conflict.

The US is planning to help Israel shoot down any incoming missiles and drones from Iran and is moving two US Navy destroyers nearby, according to reports — as the Jewish state awaits retaliation for its assassination of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader.
The tense situation in the Middle East was compounded on Saturday after Hezbollah, an Iran proxy in Lebanon, launched 40 rockets into northern Israel.

The Israeli military responded hours later with airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces announced.
Some of Hezbollah’s rockets were intercepted, while others fell into open areas, the military explained.

Hezbollah continued to send more drones into Israel throughout Saturday, including one that exploded on a kibbutz and seriously wounded an IDF reserve soldier, the army said.
The IDF launched additional attacks on the sources of the drones in southern Lebanon, it added.

Israel is still on high alert for a direct attack from Iran, which experts said was expected imminently. However, Hezbollah’s rocket attack appeared to be just another continuation of cross-border attacks that the terrorist group has been carrying out regularly since the Israel-Gaza war began. 
By Friday, the US moved two guided-missile destroyers capable of intercepting drones and incoming missiles closer to Israel in anticipation of the attack, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The US is prepared to help Israel incept missiles from Iran, which is reportedly readying a revenge strike for the April 1 Israeli attack that killed seven Iranian military officers, CNN reported, citing sources.
One person familiar with US intelligence told the outlet that the country had readied as many as 100 cruise missiles.

Tehran’s direct attack on Israeli soil would mark a serious escalation of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which now threatens to give way to a larger regional conflict.
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, and Tehran has been accused of encouraging the former’s Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel.
President Biden said Friday that the revenge attack would come “sooner than later.”
“Don’t,” the president cautioned Tehran.

“We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel and help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” he added.
The US recently observed Iran moving military assets internally, CNN reported.

Even with US support, it would be difficult for Israel to defend itself from such massive bombardment, one expert told CBS News on Friday.
“Iran will bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further,” IDF Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari vowed Saturday.
Israel also coped with internal strife Saturday as settlers in the West Bank rampaged through the village of al-Mughayyir and injured six Palestinians, the Times of Israel reported.

Footage from the scene showed the illegal settlers firing in the direction of the Palestinians and throwing stones at them, the outlet said.
One person was critically wounded after being shot in the head.
The clash broke out shortly after the body of Benjamin Achimeir – a 14-year-old Israeli boy from Jerusalem – was found near al-Mughayyir, the Times of Israel explained.
Achimeir vanished early Friday when he went out shepherding. The IDF has classified his murder as a terror attack, the Times of Israel noted.
Before the teen’s body was found, Israeli settlers set fire to houses and cars in al-Mughayyir, the outlet said.
One person, 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia, was killed in that initial conflict.
Tensions between Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank have heated up in the months since Oct. 7, sparking concerns that Hamas will take advantage of the conflict to infiltrate those communities.

					Reza Pahlavi, the Crown Prince of Iran photographed in Washington, DC. The exiled heir hopes to help his countrymen transition away from extremism and toward secular and democratic rule.						
							Samuel Corum for NY Post						




Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi – the son of the last Shah of Iran and heir to the Peacock Throne – hasn’t been home in 45 years. Neither has his wife, Yasmine.
Their three daughters, raised in the suburbs of Washington, DC, have never set foot in their ancestral homeland. 
Now 63, Pahlavi left Iran at age 17 for military school in the United States just before his cancer-stricken father, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, relinquished the throne on Jan. 16, 1979. 
The Shah’s departure left behind a leadership vacuum filled by Ruhollah Khomeini, which catalyzed Iran’s transformation into the conservative theocracy cut off from the Western world that we now know today.

Since that time, Pahlavi, who studied the nonviolent philosophies of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, has remained transfixed on one goal: igniting a revolution that replaces the brutal regime now governing Iran with a secular democracy chosen by and for the Iranian people.

“The Islamic regime is the root cause of the problems we see in the region, whether it’s terrorism, radicalism or the nuclear proliferation threat,” Pahlavi recently told The Post. “It’s in the ayatollahs’ DNA to be an enemy to modernization and progress. Look at what Dubai is today compared to 40 years ago,” he continues. “Instead of becoming the next Japan, Iran has become the next North Korea.” 
Pahlavi’s words come months into the Hamas war with Israel — a conflict with deep roots in Tehran’s commitment to exporting extremism far beyond its borders. 
The mullahs’ support of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has been extensively chronicled, and recent reporting showed that Iran has also been smuggling arms to the West Bank to foment further unrest in Israel.

Such ambitions — along with Iran’s increasing closeness with Russia and China — help explain Pahlavi’s belief that Western governments should stop engaging in futile diplomacy with the Islamic Republic and focus more on empowering Iranians directly. 
“Iranian people represent the true agents of change,” he said. “We should be investing in them, not paying the regime more money to continue . . . financing their proxies.” 





When the US is weak in its foreign policy, Tehran is emboldened to sow chaos at home and abroad, Pahlavi continues. 
Executions in Iran, the regime’s military spend and its nuclear weapons advancement have all increased significantly as administrations under Obama and Biden appeased, rather than challenged, the regime, according to the National Union for Democracy in Iran. 
“The premise of dealing with the regime in terms of negotiation and diplomacy is based on the false expectation of behavior change,” Pahlavi said, adding that the Hamas attack on Israel occurred, in part, because Tehran was emboldened by weakness out of Washington, such as Biden’s back-door deal last year to transfer $6 billion to Iran in exchange for five US prisoners.

Pahlavi’s supporters, consisting of secularists, constitutional monarchists and liberal democrats, laud him as the man who should have been Shah. 
For them, he is an assiduous statesman who last year represented the Iranian people’s democratic aspirations in official visits to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the Munich Security Conference and Israel.
Although Israel and Iran remain locked in a shadow war edging precipitously closer toward nuclear brinkmanship — particularly after an Israeli strike in Damascus in early April killed senior Iranian military commanders — Pahlavi envisages the unthinkable: a Cyrus Accords between Israel and a post-Ayatollah Iran. 
Although still a dream, it would be modeled on both the existing Abraham Accords between Israel and Gulf states, as well as the decades of close trade and military partnerships both countries enjoyed before the revolution. 
Pahlavi imagines a NATO-like intergovernmental alliance that advances peace, not war. 
“Imagine a region where Iran, Israel, Saudi and the UAE redirect money allocated to defense and security to education and healthcare,” he explains.

But regional instability has instead dominated Tehran’s foreign policy agenda. 
Hamas’ abduction of 253 mostly Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 relied on a strategy emanating from Tehran, whose leaders pioneered captive diplomacy with the 444-day US embassy hostage crisis in 1979. 
The Islamic Republic has since leveraged hostage taking as a winning strategy to coax the U.S. and allies into those prisoner swaps and financial rewards. 
“When you reward hostage taking by paying a ransom, what do you expect? More hostages,” Pahlavi says. 
The Hamas attacks in October were also timed to “sabotage” momentum toward a landmark, U.S.-brokered Israeli-Saudi peace agreement. Such a Sunni-Israeli alliance would have threatened Shia-majority Iran’s regional ambitions, as the U.S. rewarded Riyadh with advanced weapons and military technology in exchange for recognizing Jerusalem.

As Pahlavi explains, his grand plan for the downfall of the Islamic Republic is multi-fold: First apply “maximum pressure” on the regime through harsher sanctions on senior government and military officials — along with formal terrorist designations for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by the UK and EU. 
Then provide “maximum support” for the Iranian people, who have staged several unsuccessful attempts in recent years to unseat the Islamic Republic. 
In 2009, for instance, millions of Iranians disputed the presidential re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Then, from 2017-2019, desperate Iranians protested over water scarcity, economic hardship and political repression.

But no movement posed as existential a threat to the Islamic Republic as the uprising in September 2022, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini after she was arrested for failing to wear her hijab appropriately.
Although the movement gained worldwide attention, it faded out after mere months with little material impact on the regime. 
Opposition leadership in the Iranian diaspora unraveled abroad while Iran’s security forces launched a violent campaign of arrests and executions at home. 
More than 537 protesters were killed and and at least 20,000 were arrested. 
The slaughter continued into 2023, which saw 853 executions across Iran, the highest number on record since 2015.


10

Such numbers, while sobering, have mostly gone unreported. 
“There’s always less media attention on Iranian people’s causes than others,” Pahlavi said, referring to the Israel-Palestine conflict and Ukraine war. 
Part of the problem is the White House — where “the Biden administration [has] neglected to take concrete actions to support the Iranian people, who are in a David-versus-Goliath battle,” he says. “Goliath spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on PR while also restricting Internet access to its people to communicate among themselves and with the outside world.” 
Still, Pahlavi remains undeterred as revolutionary fervor persists within Iran. 
The parliamentary elections this past March, for instance, tested the regime’s long-term legitimacy as voter turnout sunk to historic lows. “We don’t need foreign countries to intervene to remove the regime,” he said. “Iranians demand change and are paying with their lives every day.”
As for what role he might play in Iran should the theocracy collapse, Pahlavi remains vague. “I’m not running for any office or position,” he notes. “For me, the finish line is the day people go to the polls and finally participate in a referendum to decide their fate.”

In the meantime Pahlavi relies on his modest secretariat, or cabinet-in-exile, consisting of a handful of close political and media advisors that run his schedule and accompany him to speaking engagements.  
Pahlavi, of course, has his detractors. 
As the son of Iran’s last authoritarian monarch overthrown in a bloody revolution, many view him as lacking any real meaningful influence. 
As Thomas Juneau, assistant professor at the University of Ottowa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs has written on X, Pahlavi is surrounded by “close advisors [who] are toxic, far-right individuals who cause major damage to the opposition in exile (and so help the Islamic Republic).”
“A cult of personality has grown around Reza Pahlavi which portrays him as a man he is not and never can be,” added Alireza Nader, an Iran scholar and former Rand policy analyst. 
“According to this cult, Pahlavi alone can save Iran from the Islamic Republic. No other political figure matters, and if anyone challenges or criticizes Pahlavi, he or she is called a traitor.”

Still, no opposition figure comes close to Pahlavi’s support inside Iran and abroad. 
A recent survey by the Empirical Research and Forecasting Institute found that 79.9% of Iranians opted for Pahlavi as their favored leader over current rulers or alternative opposition figures. 
Iranians are also increasingly looking to secularize their country, with a government survey leaked to BBC Persian showing support for a demarcation between religion and state climbing from 31% in 2015 to 74% today.

A key factor of Pahlavi’s popularity is his consistent, decades-long vision for a secular and democratic Iran that adheres to nationalist sentiments already rising in the country, says Saeed Ghasseminejad, senior Iran advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
“The only alternative to the Islamic Republic’s radical Islamism that can mobilize the masses is nationalism,” Ghasseminejad said. “The three waves of widespread protests over the last six years all had strong nationalist tendencies. The crown prince, because of his position, name, and background, is naturally perceived as the leader of this return to Iran’s national identity.”

For Pahlavi, his “patriotic duty” and mission for the past 40 years have been to place Iran’s democratic transition directly in the hands of its people. “My role is to ensure we have an interim government that prepares the stage for the elections where these debates about Iran’s future and what ultimately people want takes place.” 
Jonathan Harounoff is the author of the forthcoming book “Unveiled: Inside Iran’s #WomenLifeFreedom Revolt.”

Published 
April 12, 2024, 5:27 p.m. ET













Gen. Omar Bradley is often credited with the saying, “Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.” The Biden administration does neither.
In September 2022, we argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “Arsenals of Evil” — North Korea and Iran — couldn’t help the Kremlin retrieve its faltering position in Ukraine.
We were wrong. 
We didn’t factor in Washington throwing in the towel after Putin’s “special military operation” was on the ropes.



President Biden left the US badly exposed to Russia and China, a process that began when he prematurely withdrew troops from Afghanistan, Jonathan Sweet and Mark Toth write. REUTERS

The two rogue states, each as anti-American as it gets, are providing Putin with drones, artillery and cruise missiles to defeat the United States and our NATO allies in Ukraine, all while pursuing their nuclear weapons programs unabated.
To underscore the extent to which America has fallen behind, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, head of US Central Command, testified before Congress that “the Russians are firing five times as many artillery shells as the Ukrainians.”

								The epic fail of Biden’s doctrine vs. Iran — no consequences							










Kurilla warned that Putin’s advantage in artillery shells would increase to 10 to 1 “in a matter of weeks.”
Russia is outproducing the US and NATO — churning out 250,000 artillery munitions per month, while NATO’s artillery coalition, led by France and the Czech Republic, is forced to scrounge on the open market to secure a one-time purchase of 800,000 rounds.
According to a senior European intelligence official, the US and Europe, collectively, can produce just 100,000 munitions each month. 
And they’re not even doing that.
The arsenals of democracy are failing.
Franklin Roosevelt is likely turning in his grave at Hyde Park, especially given that it’s Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, now occupying the White House.

		Biden’s vote-buying student debt ploy says ‘Screw you’ to taxpayers, Congress and SCOTUS	






We’ve long urged Biden to put the country on a war footing to defeat Putin in Ukraine, deter future Russian aggression in Europe and check Chinese President Xi Jinping’s designs on Taiwan and the greater Indo-Pacific.
Democracy is in real danger of losing to tyranny.
Ukraine has now been at war for 777 days. 
Yet here we are, without a plan to win or a sufficient level of weapons and munitions production to meet an array of cascading kinetic conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, Israel and Iranian-backed attacks on US forces and commercial shipping in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and the Red Sea.
Taiwan sits more exposed than ever. 
Beijing undoubtedly sees the opening and is poised to exploit it.
We are no longer in either/or territory.
Biden lost that opportunity when he failed to put Putin down for the count by enabling Kyiv to retake Crimea.
Just as World War II required an “all of the above” response, so too does this increasingly kinetic World War III.
Yet Biden, along with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, has been utterly derelict in their approach.
He’s left the nation badly exposed to Russia and China, a process that began when he prematurely withdrew US troops from Afghanistan.
Emerging exigencies, including Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power grid and the growing potential for an all-out war between Israel and Iran, now require a bold new commitment from Biden. 
The White House must focus on winning this global war with Moscow and Beijing and their arsenal of evil partners.
Instead of recognizing the gravity of the overall strategic situation and leveling with the American people that we are, in effect, facing a World War III, the White House is admonishing US allies to tamp back their fights against our nation’s enemies so as to not risk Biden losing in Michigan or elsewhere.

Biden & Co. have told Israel to refrain from defeating Hamas in Rafah.
Likewise, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin admonished Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to stop attacking Russian oil refineries, lest global oil prices rise — and, presumably, dim Biden’s re-election prospects come November.
Instead, Austin urged Ukraine to focus on military targets.
Sorry, but Russian oil refineries are military targets: They’re used to facilitate the transport of Russian troops and munitions to the front lines in Ukraine — and generate revenue to finance the war.
Biden, Blinken, Sullivan and Austin have lost the plot. 
They’re aware of the US’s dire armaments production situation; they’ve borrowed munitions from forward-deployed arsenals in Israel and South Korea to aid in Ukraine’s war effort.

Yet Biden’s overall national intelligence strategy fails to realize that all of the dots it maps are connected — and, allegorically speaking, clearly form the maps of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.
Former President Barack Obama was right when he warned folks never to underestimate Biden’s ability to f–k things up.
The president is doing just that at a national security level, and at the worst possible moment.
Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Sweet served 30 years as a military intelligence officer. Mark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy.

WASHINGTON — President Biden said Friday that his message to Iran is “don’t” attack Israel — after forecasting that Tehran is likely to do so “sooner than later.”
The 81-year-old commander in chief addressed two days of fevered speculation of a looming attack on the set of the “fake” White House in an office building adjacent to the West Wing.
Asked “how imminent” an attack on Israel may be, Biden said, “my expectation is sooner than later” following his virtual address to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.

Asked for his message to Iran, Biden said a single word: “Don’t.”

“We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” he said in response to another question.
Hours earlier, the White House refused to say how the US would respond if Iran acts on its “very credible” threats to strike Israel — as fears grow that such an attack could trigger a wider war across the Middle East.
While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the Biden administration considers Tehran’s warnings against the Jewish state to be “viable,” he declined to detail what Washington would do should an attack occur.

“We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel,” Kirby said. 
“We are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks, but I really don’t want to get into armchair quarterbacking this thing in a public way.”

Iran says any attack would be in retaliation for Israel’s April 1 strike near the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, which killed Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who managed paramilitary operations in Syria and Lebanon, and at least six other Iranian militants, according to Iranian state media and US officials. 


4

Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to say whether the US military would respond to an Iranian strike on Israel ZUMAPRESS.com
Zahedi was the highest-ranking Iranian military official to be killed since the January 2020 US assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.
On Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder also refused to answer questions on a potential US response to an attack from Iran, saying he wouldn’t “get into hypotheticals.”
“We’re certainly monitoring the situation closely,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball and I’m not going to get into specific intelligence.”
Rich Goldberg, the former official in charge of countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction in the Trump White House and a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Post the US focus is on preventing Iranian drones or missiles from reaching Israeli territory.
“My understanding through sources in both countries is that the cooperation between US Central Command and the Israel Defense Forces right now is at a maximalist, unprecedented level, so there is a very enhanced state of cooperation right now on the threat,” Goldberg said.
While the Biden administration has refused to talk about possible responses against Iran, Goldberg saidit would be highly unusual for Israel to ask for US assistance should it need to retaliate.
“Israel has never asked the United States to fight on its behalf or to intervene on its behalf and I would be shocked to learn that it has done so,” he said.
Still, Goldberg noted that the Pentagon has assets in the Middle East that could help shoot down an incoming missile from Iran, should it be necessary.

“To the extent that the US is providing missile defense support, that would be in accordance with US policy doctrine and 20 years of military exercises between the United States military and Israeli military, so that, to me, is appropriate,” he said.
The calculus would likely change if Iran moves against US forces in the region.
“It would be imprudent if we didn’t take a look at our own posture in the region to make sure that we’re properly prepared as well,” Kirby said Friday.
Tehran reportedly told its allies last week that it would attack American military bases if Washington should get involved in the fighting between Iran and Israel, Axios reported Friday, citing unnamed US officials.
“The Iranian message was we will attack the forces that attack us, so don’t f–k with us and we won’t f–k with you,” one official told Axios.

Goldberg further noted that there appears to be some “signaling of major escalation prepared by the Israelis … if there is a direct missile attack from Iran.”
“That would be in the form of one of their intermediate-range or medium-range ballistic missiles, a cruise missile” that could “cause a large amount of destruction.”
The Iranian regime has not made a final decision regarding how and when to launch the attack, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
“The strike plans are in front of the Supreme Leader and he is still weighing the political risk,” an adviser to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told the outlet.

Many unknowns remain around Iran’s promised retaliation against Israel for its killing of a cluster of Quds Force fighters (including top brass) in Syria.
One thing is certain, however: This is President Biden’s foreign policy working by design. 
That’s why America’s most committed regional enemy is menacing our most important regional ally, as US analysts sit and mull over the size and scope of the strike — and the White House basically wrings its hands. 
Not that Iran needs to do anything big.

Thanks to Biden, Iran already is winning the battle for regional supremacy with proxy actions.
Israel’s already fighting an Iranian proxy on one front in Gaza as another, Hezbollah, has been launching rockets across the border with Lebanon and exchanging fire with Israeli forces in what may well be a prelude to open war.  
Meanwhile, the president, guided both by short-term hopes of winning back lefty voters and by a cadre of demented lefties on his staff, has abandoned Israel. 
But from the day he took office, long before Iran struck Israel via its cat’s-paw Hamas, Biden has empowered and emboldened Tehran.

He handed it billions in ransom and sanctions relief, broke off relations with the Saudis and did all he could to resuscitate President Barack Obama’s disastrous 2015 nuclear deal. 
And now we face the possibility of hot hostilities between Israel and Iran. 
Perhaps Biden’s calculation is that Iran will make a conservative play here.

But if Tehran, say, dares a major strike against a soft target: What then?
The US must respond. 
Biden cannot continue to base his Mideast strategy on hopes and fairy tales about Iran. 

An attack by the ayatollahs cannot be shrugged off.
Whatever happens, know that Biden owns this disaster, and that absent political change in November, the policy fundamentals that produced it will go on making the world less safe.

The threat of a widening war in the Middle East coupled with disappointing earnings reports from US banks prompted a selloff on Wall Street on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 475 points, finishing at 37,983, and has now lost roughly 5% off its record high after flirting with the 40,000 barrier to close out March.
The S&P 500 sank 1.5% – dropping more than 75 points, while the Nasdaq was down 267 points, or 1.6%.

Oil prices soared above $90 a barrel, on threats by Iran that it will launch an attack against Israel as early as this weekend.

Back home, JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s biggest bank by assets, reported quarterly profits of 6%, but shares dropped after its forecast for income from interest payments fell short of analysts’ expectations.
Citigroup, meanwhile, saw first-quarter profit drop 27% as the bank continues to restructure itself and slim down after selling off much of its international franchises post pandemic.

Wells Fargo’s profit fell 7% in the first quarter as it paid more to hold customer deposits while demand from borrowers declined.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, in a call with analysts after the mixed earnings report, reiterated his concerns that inflation would continue to weigh on the US economy.

All three indexes posted losses for the week. AP
“Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” Dimon said, citing the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as other geopolitical pressures, high amounts of government spending and “persistent inflationary pressures” as part of an “unsettling” global landscape.
The market selloff is a result of a transition from “overoptimism” on the part of investors who expected interest rate cuts to “over pessimism” that the Fed will keep interest rates where they are, according to Dr. Sung Won Sohn, a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

According to Sohn, the market rally since October – which has seen the Dow climb by more than 12% – were based on expectations of interest rate cuts.
“The tailwind has disappeared and it’s become somewhat of a headwind,” Sohn told The Post.
He also cited the price of oil, which could soar to between $100 and $150 a barrel if Iran attacks Israel and triggers a regional conflict.
“The stock market was overvalued to begin with,” he said. “Now they are reversing and becoming concerned about the future.”

Shares of JPMorgan and other big banks fell as they reported earnings. REUTERS
Earlier this week, the federal government released data showing that inflation in March rose 3.5% year-over-year – a reading that came in a higher than the 3.4% that economists anticipated.
Sticky inflation has tamped down expectations on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates at least three times this year.

A new consensus is emerging among investors who now say that any rate cut would be implemented in September at the earliest.
Initial projections had the Fed cutting rates beginning in June.
