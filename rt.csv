        Iran launches swarm of kamikaze drones at Israel

    
                    Tehran has fired dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles in apparent retaliation for an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus
            An Iranian Shahed drone is shown at a weapons exhibition. Iran launched an attack against Israel on Saturday night using dozens of drones and missiles, in apparent retaliation for a recent strike by the Jewish state that killed seven military officers at its consulate in Damascus.Axios reported the drone swarm on Saturday, citing four unidentified US and Israeli officials. Videos posted on social media purported to show Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being fired toward Israel from Iran.Earlier on Saturday, US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his national security advisers due to fears of an “imminent” Iranian attack against Israel. Tehran, which had vowed to take revenge for the April 1 killing of its officers, seized an Israeli-operated container ship in the Persian Gulf around noon on Saturday.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari warned in a video statement that Iran would “bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further. Israel is on high alert.” Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US assets in the region amid West Jerusalem’s war with Hamas.

        Iran attacks Israel: Live updates

    
                    Tehran has launched retaliatory strikes following a deadly airstrike that killed two Iranian generals earlier this month
            An Israeli soldier stands atop a tank in a army camp near Israel's border with Gaza, April 8, 2024 ©                 AFP / Menahem KahanaIran has launched a wave of drones toward Israel, after American officials warned that hundreds of drones and missiles could rain down on the Jewish state over the weekend.Iran accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike on its consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus earlier this month. The strike killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Israel stuck to its usual policy of silence on extraterritorial assassinations, but is widely believed to have been behind the attack.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to deal Israel a “slap in the face” in response, and American officials warned on Friday that Tehran could be gearing up for a massive drone and missile strike on Israeli soil in the following 24 to 48 hours. The Iranian response appeared to begin at midday on Saturday when IRGC commandos seized an Israeli-linked container ship in the Strait of Hormuz. This live stream has ended.14 April 202407:48 GMTIran has no plans to continue its military operation against Israel, the chief of staff of the Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, says. However, he warned West Jerusalem that if it takes any further offensive actions against Tehran, they would be met with a “much more extensive” response.07:17 GMTThe head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Major General Hossein Salami, claimed that Tehran’s attack on Israel was even more successful than previously believed.“Up to this moment, our information on all the hits is not complete, but the part of the hits that we have accurate… reports about shows… that this operation happened with more success than expected,” he said, as quoted by the IRNA news agency.He added that the “Zionist authorities and the terrorist army” as well as the US, Israel’s ally, “have recognized the devastating effects of these strikes better than we did.”06:47 GMTPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that Israel has successfully repelled the Iranian drone and missile strikes. “We have stopped them… Together we will win,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).06:23 GMTUS President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington would not support an Israeli counterattack against Iran in retaliation for the massive missile and drone strikes, Axis reported, citing unnamed US officials.The US is said to be extremely concerned that an Israeli response could trigger a major war with “catastrophic consequences.” In light of this, Biden advised Netanyahu to “take the win,” according to an Axios source.The Israeli prime minister reportedly told Biden that he understands the US stance on retaliatory strikes.05:57 GMTThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it has conducted airstrikes on military sites belonging to Iranian-linked Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces, a special unit whose primary mission is to infiltrate Israeli territory, in the Jbaa area of southern Lebanon.Israeli fighter jets also struck Hezbollah military sites in the Khiam and Kfarkela areas in the same region, the IDF added, sharing a video of the raids.מטוסי קרב תקפו לפני זמן קצר במחנה השייך לכוח רדואן, מספר מבנים במרחב הכפר ג׳בע שבדרום לבנון.מוקדם יותר הלילה מטוסי קרב תקפו מבנים צבאיים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחבים אל-חיאם וכפר כילא pic.twitter.com/dlMSOrqR38— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) April 14, 202405:35 GMTIsrael has reopened its airspace after being closed for seven hours due to the Iranian attack, according to the country’s Airports Authority. It added, however, that some flight schedules are subject to change.05:00 GMTThe Pentagon has confirmed that US military forces in the Middle East intercepted “dozens” of drones and missiles “en route to Israel” launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen on Saturday.“Our forces remain postured to protect US troops and partners in the region, provide further support for Israel’s defense, and enhance regional stability,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.He urged Iran to “immediately halt any further attacks,” adding that while the US is not seeking a direct confrontation with Iran, it will not “hesitate to act” in the event of a potential threat to US military forces or in support for Israeli defense.03:17 GMT

President Joe Biden has praised the US military and American servicemembers for helping the IDF to deflect what he called an “unprecedented air attack against military facilities in Israel.""”At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said in a statement published by the White House.03:16 GMTIran’s Foreign Ministry said that the Islamic Republic “will not hesitate to take more defensive measures to protect its legitimate interests against any aggressive military actions and illegal use of force,” referring to the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria.Citing the goals and principles of the UN charter, Tehran reaffirmed “its determination to forcefully defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any unlawful use of force and aggressions,” the ministry added as cited by semi-government IRNA news agency.02:47 GMTUS President Joe Biden held a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following a meeting with his national security team, but the details of the discussions have not been disclosed.More

        Iran confirms ‘extensive’ strike against Israel

    
                    The Islamic Republic has launched multiple drones on the Jewish state, according to media reports
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 Global Look Press / Iranian Army OfficeA military operation has been carried out against Israeli targets in the Occupied Palestinian territories, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement on Saturday night. The drone and missile strike was a response to “numerous crimes” committed by West Jerusalem, it claimed, including an attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, it added.“In response to the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes... and the martyrdom of a number of our country’s commanders and military advisors in Syria, the IRGC’s Aerospace Division launched tens of missiles and drones against certain targets inside the occupied territories,” the statement said.The exact targets of the strike remain unknown. It is also unclear if the IRGC was referring to the Occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank or Israeli territory when announcing the strike. Several media outlets earlier reported that multiple drones were targeting Israeli territory. Tehran said it would provide further details about the operation soon.The development came two weeks after an alleged Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The attack, which took place on April 1, killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals.

        Biden convenes security meeting over Iranian attack

    
                    Washington has responded to the latest salvo in the Middle East by reiterating its “ironclad” support for Israel’s security
            ©                 AP / Pablo Martinez MonsivaisThe administration of US President Joe Biden has reacted to an Iranian drone attack against Israel by vowing steadfast support for West Jerusalem. The president cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his national security advisers.“President Biden has been clear: Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad,” US National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said on Saturday in a White House statement. “The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran.”The statement was issued shortly after Iran launched a swarm of suicide drones against Israel on Saturday night, in apparent retaliation for a missile strike that killed seven military officers at its consulate in Damascus earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the drone raid, saying it was launched from within Iranian territory.

Watson said the attack is “likely to unfold over a number of hours.” Biden is receiving regular updates on the situation from his national security advisers. “His team is in constant communication with Israeli officials, as well as other partners and allies,” the spokeswoman added.”Hours before the drones were launched, Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his advisers on fears of an “imminent” Iranian strike against Israel.US defense chief Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, in a telephone call earlier on Saturday. Their conversation concerned “urgent regional threats” and “unwavering US support for Israel’s defense,” Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said. “Secretary Austin made clear that Israel could count on full US support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies.”

Iranian-backed militias have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US assets across the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began last October. Iranian forces seized an Israeli-operated container ship in the Persian Gulf around midday on Saturday.Tehran has vowed to take revenge against Israel for the April 1 airstrike on its Syria consulate. Shortly after Saturday’s drone attack began, the X (formerly Twitter) account of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reposted a clip from the Iranian supreme leader’s speech on Wednesday denouncing the missile strike.“When they attack our consulate, it is as if they have attacked our soil,” Khamenei said in the speech. “The malicious regime made a mistake on this matter, and it must be punished and will be punished.”

        Iran warns foreign nations against helping Israel

    
                    Any country that provides air or land passage for West Jerusalem’s troops will face Tehran’s wrath, the Islamic Republic has said
            FILE PHOTO: Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani ©                 Global Look Press / DefanewsAny nation that helps Israel attack Iran will face serious consequences, the Islamic Republic’s defense minister, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, warned early Sunday. His statement came as Tehran launched a massive airstrike against the Jewish state, in what it called retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian consulate in Syria.“Any country that opens its airspace or soil to Israel to attack Iran will receive our decisive response,” Ashtiani said.Iran’s mission to the UN also demanded that the US “stay away” from the conflict between Tehran and West Jerusalem. This is a bilateral issue, the mission said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday night. The Islamic Republic has the right to respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which grants every nation the right to self-defense, the statement said, pointing to Israeli “aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus.”

Earlier, Tehran confirmed that it had launched multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Israel and announced an imminent missile strike. The Israeli military tracked more than 100 drones heading towards the country, local media reported, adding that the UAVs are expected to reach Israel “within hours” and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will work to intercept them mid-air.The development prompted several Middle Eastern nations, including Jordan and Lebanon, to close their airspace. Amman also declared a state of emergency.The targets of the attack remain unclear. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) called the attack retaliation against Israel’s “numerous crimes,” including an early April strike targeting an Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus.The attack killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals, and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there would be a response. The US warned Israel on Friday that Tehran could launch a massive strike against it over the weekend.

        Israel & allies intercept incoming Iranian drones – media

    
                    West Jerusalem and its allies have reportedly shot down more than 100 UAVs
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 Global Look Press / JINI / Ayal MargolinThe US and other Western allies are reportedly helping Israel to defend against retaliatory Iranian airstrikes, deploying fighter jets and other defenses to intercept incoming drones and cruise missiles before they reach Israeli territory.American forces began shooting down unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the skies over Iraq and Syria on Saturday night, according to unconfirmed Israeli reports. More than 100 Iranian kamikaze drones were taken out by US and UK forces before they reached West Jerusalem’s airspace, the Israeli military’s Army Radio outlet reported.Israeli and British fighter jets were reportedly launched to intercept Iranian drones over Jordan. UK pilots allegedly took off from Cyprus after Iran began launching suicide drones against Israel on Saturday night, in apparent retaliation for a missile strike earlier this month that killed seven military officers at the Iranian consulate in Damascus.With Tehran vowing revenge, US and Israeli leaders have been bracing for attacks in recent days. US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach house earlier on Saturday, returning to the White House to meet with his national security advisers. “We are devoted to the defense of Israel,” Biden said before the drone raids began. “We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed.”

Local broadcaster Channel 12 reported that in addition to the drone swarms, cruise missiles were launched into Israel. The Houthi rebels in Yemen launched drones toward Eilat, the outlet said. The Houthis and other Iranian-backed militias have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US targets across the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began last October.

The Iranian Defense Ministry warned its neighbors against allowing Israel to use their airspace for strikes against Tehran. Iran launched Shahed UAVs from within its own territory, and the drones apparently passed through Iraqi and Syrian airspace on their way to Israel.Israel is preparing for several days of clashes with Iran, and an Israeli response to Saturday’s airstrikes is expected, broadcaster KAN reported. Earlier on Saturday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari warned that Iran would “bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further.”

Israel is preparing for several days of clashes with Iran, and an Israeli response to Saturday’s airstrikes is expected, local broadcaster KAN reported. Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN suggested that Tehran may be satisfied with its retaliation for the attack on its Syrian consulate.“The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said in a statement. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the US must stay away.”The statement also noted that Saturday’s military action was carried out under Article 51 off the UN Charter, concerning the rights of nations to “legitimate defense.”

        Iran vows to punish ‘evil Zionist regime’

    
                    Tehran has reiterated Ayatollah Khamenei’s pledge to avenge the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria
            Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, April 10, 2024. ©                 Khamenei Media on XThe Iranian authorities have reposted an address by the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, in which he vowed to punish Israel for the attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which occurred earlier this month.A video of the April 10 speech was widely shared across Iranian government accounts on X (formerly Twitter) early Sunday, following the launch of Iranian drones against Israel. In the address, the supreme leader condemned the Israeli airstrike on the compound that killed seven Iranian officers, including two high-ranking generals, and compared the strike to an attack on Iran itself.“The malicious regime itself, which is all malice, evil, and error, added another mistake to its own errors by launching an attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria,” Khamenei said, noting that “the consulate and embassy offices in any country where they exist are regarded as the soil of the country to which the embassy belongs.”He added that Israel’s actions “should be punished and will be punished.”

Tehran launched a barrage of drones towards Israel late Saturday. According to media reports, US officials estimate that up to 500 drones and missiles launched from various locations, including Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, will rain down on Israel over the weekend.The permanent mission of Iran to the UN issued a statement overnight, saying “Iran’s military action” constitutes “a legitimate defense” based on the UN charter. “The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission added, warning of “considerably more severe” consequences if Israel continues on its current course. The agency said the conflict is exclusively between Tehran and West Jerusalem, stressing that “the US must stay away.”

        Netanyahu convenes war cabinet

    
                    Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his nation after Iran launched waves of drones towards Israel
            The Israeli war cabinet, chaired by PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Tel Aviv, Israel, April 14, 2024.  © Getty Images /                 Israeli Government Press Office / Handout/AnadoluIsrael is ready to harm whoever harms it, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement early Sunday after Iran launched several waves of drones at Israel in response to the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.Tehran accused West Jerusalem of the April 1 airstrike, which killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. While Israel has kept silent on the matter – its usual policy on extraterritorial assassinations – it is widely believed to have carried out the attack. Iran has vowed to deal Israel a “slap in the face,” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying West Jerusalem “should be punished” and “will be punished.”Following the launch of Iranian drones and missiles towards Israel on Saturday night, Netanyahu released a video statement in which he announced that West Jerusalem has been preparing for a direct attack by Tehran for years and especially in recent weeks.

“Our defensive systems are deployed; we are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively,” he said, thanking the US, UK, France, and other countries for supporting Israel.We have determined a clear principle: Whoever harms us, we will harm them.Netanyahu has gathered his war cabinet in Tel Aviv, his office wrote on X (formerly Twitter). The team of US President Joe Biden is in constant communication with Israeli officials as the situation unfolds, the White House stated in a press release, reiterating their support for Israel.

The attack, which took place on April 1, killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals.The Islamic Republic’s attack involved more than 100 drones, Israeli and Western media reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it tracked incoming unmanned aerial vehicles and intercepted them mid-air, with help from allied forces.

In a statement, the IRGC warned the US that any support it provides to Israel that harms Iran’s interests would be met with a “decisive response.” Tehran considers Washington “responsible for the evil actions” of West Jerusalem, the statement added. Iran also warned its neighbors against assisting the US or Israel in potentially attacking the Islamic Republic.In the wake of the Iranian strikes, Israeli media reported that the government is planning a massive retaliation. TV Channel 12 cited a senior Israeli official as saying that an “unprecedented response” to the attack is in the works. Israel’s culture and sports minister, Miki Zohar, also stated that West Jerusalem “received broad international legitimacy tonight to strike Iran with unprecedented force.”

While Israel has remained silent on the airstrike – its usual habit after extraterritorial assassinations – Tehran has accused the IDF of attacking its embassy.More than 300 drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles were fired from Iran overnight, the IDF said in a press release on Sunday morning.

Around 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles were intercepted by air defenses, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Hagari said. He added that of the 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles fired at Israel overnight, only a few of the ballistic missiles made it past the IDF’s air defenses, hitting Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel and inflicting “minor damage.”

Iranian attack on Israel

        US helped Israel take down ‘nearly all’ Iranian drones and missiles – Biden

    
                    The president has condemned Tehran’s “unprecedented air attack”
            US President Joe Biden, along with members of his national security team, receives updates on an ongoing attack on Israel from Iran, April 13, 2024. ©                 Adam Schultz / The White House via APPresident Joe Biden has praised the US military for helping the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repel a large-scale Iranian attack against Israeli military facilities.“At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said in a statement published by the White House following a late night phone conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.The president also reaffirmed America’s “ironclad” commitment to protect Israel, while commending Israel’s “remarkable capacity” to defend against and defeat its adversaries.

Biden said he would summon G7 leaders to discuss a joint response to Iran’s military action against Israel – indicating that the reaction would be diplomatic. “We will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” Biden stressed, while acknowledging that US forces and facilities were not affected by Tehran’s strikes.On Saturday evening, Iran launched a coordinated multi-wave drone and missile attack on Israeli military facilities. Tehran said it was in retaliation for an airstrike allegedly conducted by the IDF on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.The IRGC claimed the operation – True Promise – was a success, with multiple “important” Israeli facilities destroyed. The IDF, however, insists that most of the UAVs were destroyed mid-air, with only minor damage resulting from the attack.

        Iranian strikes on Israel: What’s known so far

    
                    Tehran has launched a massive barrage of missiles and drones in retaliation to a recent Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria
            A new wall mural is displayed at Palestine Square picturing Iran's attack on Israel in Tehran, Iran on April 14, 2024. ©                 Getty Images / Anadolu / Haydar SahinIran launched several waves of attacks against Israel overnight, apparently targeting military locations across the country. The attack triggered anti-aircraft defenses in Israel, as well as prompting Western allies, including the US and UK, to scramble jets from their bases in the Middle East in an effort to shoot down the missiles before they reach their targets.What prompted the attackThe strikes are in retaliation to an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, which occurred early this month and was attributed by Tehran to Israel. The attack left the diplomatic facility completely destroyed and killed seven officers of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.The consulate strike, which Israel has kept silent about as it usually does with regard to extraterritorial attacks, has been explicitly named as the pretext for the strikes by the IRGC. The strikes come in retaliation to “the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus,” the Quds Force stated. Scale of the attackIran has been ambiguous on the scale of the attack, with the IRGC stating that it launched “tens of missiles and drones against certain targets inside the occupied territories,” describing the strikes as “extensive.”

A majority of the incoming missiles were shot down before even reaching Israeli airspace, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari has claimed. Only a fraction made it through, inflicting minor damage in Israel, he said.Washington has provided a similar assessment of the damage, with President Joe Biden stating that the US has “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.Numerous unverified videos circulating online, however, purport to show several projectiles making it through Israeli anti-aircraft defenses, hitting targets on the ground.International reactionThe closest allies of Israel, including the US, UK, Germany, and other Western nations, were quick to condemn the strikes. Biden has convened an emergency G7 meeting to assess the situation and “coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.”

Israel and Iran have also traded accusations at the UN, with the latter insisting that it is exercising its right to self-defense in the wake of the consulate attack, while the former accused Tehran of breaching the UN Charter. Israel has requested an extraordinary UN Security Council meeting, urging the body to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Iranian attack as a “serious escalation” and urged an end to the hostilities immediately. “Neither the region nor the world can afford another war,” he stated.Prospects for further escalationIran has signaled that the massive strike was a one-time retaliatory action for the Israeli actions, rather than the beginning of a broader military campaign. Any attempts to retaliate for it, however, will be met with a greater response, the Iranian mission to the UN has said, explicitly warning the US against intervening.

“Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission stated, adding that “should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe.”A similar warning was issued by Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, who said any country “that could open its soil or airspace to Israel for a [potential] attack on Iran, will receive our decisive response.”PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is “prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense,” without, however, explicitly promising to take direct military action against Iran. Since the beginning of the escalation, the IDF has only attacked several locations in southern Lebanon said to have been used by the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah.Recap

        US worried about possible Israeli counterattack on Iran – NBC

    
                    Privately, President Joe Biden is concerned West Jerusalem is attempting to pull his country into a wider conflict
            US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Washington DC, April11, 2024  © Getty Images /                 Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesIsrael's response to Iran’s recent drone strikes could prove reckless and escalatory, officials in Washington have told NBC news on condition of anonymity, the outlet reported on Sunday.Iran launched several waves of drone and missile attacks against Israel on Saturday and Sunday, in response to an airstrike that damaged Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria and killed seven military personnel – including two generals – earlier this month. While Israel has refrained from commenting on the bombing, Tehran has accused West Jerusalem of conducting an extraterritorial assassination and attacking their embassy.Some US officials privately indicated exasperation with Israel’s decision to strike the Iranian consular building in Syria, NBC claimed, citing senior Pentagon officials as calling the strike potentially “catastrophically escalatory.”Others in the White House have expressed concerns about Israel’s future response to the Iranian attack, given both West Jerusalem’s hardline approach in its conflict with Hamas and the airstrike on the embassy in Damascus, NBC News reports. President Joe Biden has privately expressed concern that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to pull the US into a broader conflict in the Middle East, three people familiar with the comments told the news channel.

Another senior administration official said that while the White House does not believe Israel is looking for a direct war with Iran, they cannot be certain of West Jerusalem’s motives. “I don’t think they had a strategy... the Israelis don’t always make the best strategic decisions,” an anonymous senior official told NBC.Some media reports that followed the bombing of Tehran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus claimed that West Jerusalem was preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities in the event of a direct Iranian attack on Israel. According to a Western security official, the Israeli Air Force has been training for long range strikes into sensitive areas of Iran which may be linked to the country’s nuclear program, London-based Arabic outlet Elaph wrote on Tuesday.

        India calls for ‘immediate de-escalation’ amid Israel-Iran tensions 

    
                    New Delhi says it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in the Middle East, which “threatens peace and security”
            Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar at a press conference with his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, Tehran, January 15, 2024. ©                 Haydar Sahin/Anadolu via Getty ImagesNew Delhi has expressed concern over the escalating hostilities between Iran and Israel, which “threatens peace and security in the region,” the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, hours after Iran conducted a retaliatory attack on Israel.Iran has launched a massive drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month. The attack killed seven officers from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two generals.“We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence, and return to the path of diplomacy,” New Delhi said in a statement. It added that it is closely monitoring the situation and its diplomatic missions are in touch with the Indian diaspora in the region.

On Saturday, the IRGC stormed an Israeli-operated container ship – MSC Aries – in the Persian Gulf and took control of the vessel. According to Indian media, of the 25 crew members aboard the ship, 17 are Indian. “We are in touch with the Iranian authorities through diplomatic channels, both in Tehran and in Delhi, to ensure security, welfare, and early release of Indian nationals,” a government source told PTI.India issued an advisory on Friday urging citizens to avoid traveling to Iran or Israel. It asked Indians residing in the two countries to observe “utmost precautions” and “restrict movements.”Tehran launched over 200 kamikaze drones, and ballistic and cruise missiles toward Israel on Friday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson. Most of them were intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, the official claimed, adding that some reached their targets, inflicting “minor damage.” Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was quoted by IRNA news agency as saying it launched “tens of missile and drones” and “successfully hit and destroyed” key military targets belonging to the Israeli army in the occupied Palestinian territories, in response to “numerous Israeli crimes.”

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar traveled to Tehran earlier this year amid increasing attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden by Houthi rebels allegedly backed by Iran. Speaking to the media after talks with his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Jaishankar stated that the attacks on ships “in the vicinity of India” impact the nation’s energy and economic interests. Around 80% of India’s trade in goods with Europe passes through the Red Sea. The Indian Navy has significantly stepped up its presence in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, attacks by Houthi rebels, and increasing piracy activities, deploying dozens of warships that have responded to more than 18 incidents in the past three months.Where India Meets Russia – We are now on WhatsApp! ‎Follow and share RT India in English and in Hindi

        ‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran

    
                    Iran’s top military commander has promised a “more extensive” response in case of future attacks by West Jerusalem
            FILE PHOTO: The Chief of Staff of Tehran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri  © Global Look Press /                 Iranian Army OfficeIran has no intention of continuing its military operation against Israel, which included massive drone and missile strikes over the weekend, the chief of staff of the Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, has said.On Saturday night, Tehran launched an “extensive” barrage on the Jewish state, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated to have included more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones. The attack came in retaliation for what Iran claims to be an Israeli airstrike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month, which killed several senior Iranian military officers.Speaking in the wake of the attack on Sunday, Bagheri explained that the reason for the attack was the “Zionist regime crossed the red line” in a way which cannot be tolerated.

Israel’s actions, the general continued, could not have gone unanswered. “The Supreme Leader also said that this punishment should be carried out and, thank God, this operation was carried out with the efforts of the [Islamic] Revolutionary Guards [Corps] and the help of other armed forces.”“We see this operation as a complete result, and this operation has ended in our opinion, and we have no intention of continuing the operation,” Bagheri said, warning Israel that if it takes any further action against Iran, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”The chief of the General Staff added that Iran’s military targeted a “large information center” that provided intel to Israel and Nevatim Airbase, which it said hosted US-designed F-35 fighters involved in the raid on the consulate in Damascus.While both of these bases were destroyed, Tehran did not attack population centers, the general claimed. Israel, however, previously said that 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles had been shot down, acknowledging only minor damage to one base.

        Netanyahu claims success in defeating Iranian attack

    
                    The Israeli military says it shot down 99% of more than 300 drones and missiles launched by Tehran
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads the weekly cabinet meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on January 7, 2024. ©                 RONEN ZVULUN / POOL / AFPIsrael has successfully repelled a huge Iranian drone and missile attack launched overnight, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. His comments come after the Israeli military claimed to have intercepted 99% of the incoming aerial objects.Tehran launched an “extensive” barrage on the Jewish state over the weekend, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said included more than 300 missiles of various types and kamikaze drones. The attack came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli airstrike on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month that killed several senior Iranian military officers.On Sunday, in his first public comments since the attack, Netanyahu issued a brief message claiming success in repelling the onslaught. “We intercepted. We blocked. Together we will win,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Those remarks were echoed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who insisted that Israel, the US and its partners “thwarted this attack in a way that is unparalleled.” He also said that the attack helped the world see “the true face of Iran,” which he described as a “terrorist state.”IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari assessed that “99% of the threats launched towards Israeli territory were intercepted,” hailing the development as “a very significant strategic achievement.” He said that it was based on the technological superiority of the IDF and the support of a strong coalition.At the same time, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that Tehran had managed to hit and destroy “important military targets,” without providing further details. The IDF earlier acknowledged that one of its military bases sustained minor damage.

 Iranian attack on Israel

Iran launched a wave of drone and missile attacks toward Israel on April 13. Tehran has accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike on its consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus earlier this month that killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Israel stuck to its usual policy of silence on extraterritorial assassinations but is widely believed to have been behind the attack.
The Israeli military claimed to have intercepted 99% of the incoming projectiles.

        Ukrainian ministry reveals illegal weapon risk

    
                    The government has lost track of to whom massive amounts of weapons were distributed, Igor Klimenko has said
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 AFP / Philippe DesmazesUkrainians currently possess up to 5 million weapons that have been passed out to the population by the government, Interior Minister Igor Klimenko warned on Friday. The authorities have not been able to keep track of all the arms, the minister explained, adding that a significant number of firearms are held illegally.The list of weapons is not limited to firearms, but also includes grenades, the official told a congress of local and regional authorities, according to the Ukrinform news agency. Klimenko admitted that Kiev would tolerate the illegal possession of weapons as long as the conflict with Moscow continues.“How many weapons do our citizens have in their hands? Between 1 and 5 million… How many grenades? Quite enough as well,” the minister said at the meeting. “We… understand that they should have it because there is a war going on.”

According to Klimenko, “almost all” weapons handed out by the authorities are “accounted for,” but there is also a “a certain number” of “trophy” weapons obtained by Ukrainians outside of state control.Lawmakers are currently working on a bill that would establish a procedure for citizens to either register or surrender their arms, Klimenko said. Under the proposed rules, those in possession of weapons would have to turn them over to the police 90 days after the end of martial law, according to the minister. Alternatively, people could modify their weapons to make them comply with government regulations, he added.Ukraine is yet to develop a civilian arms possession culture, the minister said, adding that many who return from the battlefield might have mental issues.

Israel warns of Ukraine weapons spillover



Russian officials previously warned that arms sent to Kiev could find their way onto the black market and into the hands of terrorists or organized crime groups. In October 2022, the Finnish authorities reported that weapons sent to Ukraine by its Western backers found their way into the Nordic nation and ended up in the hands of local criminal groups. Arms supplied to Kiev were also reportedly found in Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands at the time.In summer 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “Western anti-tank weapons” sent to Ukraine were found around Israel’s borders. A Newsweek report published around the same time suggested that not all of the Western arms intended for Ukraine had arrived at their destination. Citing an Israeli defense official, the magazine claimed that West Jerusalem had seen signs of these weapons being smuggled from Ukraine to Iran.

        Biden told Netanyahu he won’t support retaliation against Iran – Axios

    
                    Washington is reportedly worried about a major escalation fraught with “catastrophic consequences”
            US President Joe Biden (L) and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R). ©                 GPO/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington would not support retaliatory strikes against Iran after the latter launched a barrage of missiles and drones against the Jewish state over the weekend, Axios reported on Sunday. According to an unnamed senior White House official cited by the outlet, Biden delivered the warning during a phone call on Saturday between the two leaders. Other US officials also noted that Biden and his administration are “highly concerned” that any tit-for-tat action could trigger a regional war with “catastrophic consequences.”Given those apprehensions, Biden reportedly told Netanyahu that Israel had essentially prevailed in this clash with Iran and advised him to “take the win.” The Israeli prime minister, meanwhile, said that he understood that any retaliatory action would not be supported by the US, Axios said.

‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran



Meanwhile, an unnamed Israeli official told the Times of Israel that the country’s leadership had not yet made a decision about a potential response and that the issue would be discussed at a war cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon.Iran launched a powerful attack on Israel over the weekend that involved more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The strikes came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, early this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead.The IDF claimed to have shot down 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles, a defensive operation that Israeli officials hailed as a major success.Tehran, however, struck a different tone, with its officials insisting that the barrage had “more success than expected” and claiming that two Israeli bases had been destroyed. Israel has acknowledged only minor damage to one military facility.The chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, has signaled that his country had no intention of continuing the operation, and that it was intended as a “punishment” for Israel. He warned West Jerusalem of a “much more extensive” response if it decided to launch a counterattack.

        Russia responds to Iran’s attack on Israel

    
                    Tehran launched a wave of drone and missile strikes at the Jewish state over the weekend
            Israeli Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired from Iran, in central Israel, Sunday, April 14, 2024. ©                 AP Photo/Tomer NeubergRussia’s Foreign Ministry has called on Iran and Israel to exercise restraint and avoid a further escalation of hostilities in the region. The appeal was made in a statement on Sunday, following Tehran’s drone and missile strikes on Israel over the weekend.The attacks came in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian officers, including two generals. Tehran blamed Israel for the attack. Israel has not openly acknowledged its role, but Defense Minister Yoav Gallant implied responsibility in a later statement that Israel “strikes our enemies all over the Middle East.”“We are deeply concerned with another dangerous escalation in the region,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said, noting that crises in the Middle East, particularly the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, are “often fueled by irresponsible provocative actions” that only lead to further tensions.“We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint. We hope that regional states will solve existing problems through political and diplomatic means,” the ministry added.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran launched more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones on the Jewish state, but the IDF said that most of the incoming projectiles were shot down before reaching Israeli airspace.

Iranian officials, however, claimed that the barrage had “more success than expected.” The chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, said on Sunday that Tehran considers the weekend strikes a sufficient “punishment” of Israel for the attack on its consulate and has no intention of continuing the operation. However, he promised a “much more extensive” response in case of future attacks from the IDF.Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza begabn last October. West Jerusalem accused Tehran of masterminding the deadly raid on Israel that triggered the conflict, and of backing Hamas, Hezbollah, and other pro-Palestine militant groups in the region. Tehran denied involvement in the October attack but pledged to continue to support Hamas and other Palestinian groups.

        Israel to coordinate response to Iranian attack with allies – NYT

    
                    Tehran has warned West Jerusalem against retaliation, vowing a “much more extensive” pushback
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 AP Photo/Ariel SchalitIsrael intends to coordinate its response to the recent massive Iranian drone and missile attack with its allies, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Sunday, citing sources.However, an unnamed Israeli official would not disclose to the NYT when and with whom West Jerusalem would hold those consultations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already spoken by phone with US President Joe Biden since Iran's overnight strikes. The US leader reaffirmed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel” and hailed the country’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”Biden also said that he would hold talks with G7 leaders “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” adding that the US would stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders. Several Western nations have strongly condemned Tehran’s strikes.

At the same time, Axios reported US officials as saying Biden told Netanyahu that Washington would not support an Israeli tit-for-tat response out of concern it could trigger an all-out regional war. The Times of Israel reported that West Jerusalem had yet to decide on how and whether it should respond to the attack.Meanwhile, Iran announced the end of the operation, saying that it was meant as “punishment” for what Tehran believes was an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month, which killed several senior Iranian military officers.However, Iran warned Israel that any retaliatory measures would be met with a “much more extensive” pushback.The weekend raid involved more than 300 Iranian missiles and drones, according to Israeli officials, who have claimed 99% of the projectiles were intercepted. At the same time, Iran has assessed the attack as even more successful than expected, claiming to have destroyed two Israeli facilities.

        Israel strikes ‘deep inside’ Lebanon

    
                    The attack came in response to missiles fired toward the northern part of the Jewish state overnight, according to the IDF
            ©                 Telegram/idfofficialIsrael has reported launching airstrikes deep into Lebanese territory, targeting Hezbollah positions across the country as tensions in the region soared after Iran attacked Israel over the weekend.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted to its Telegram channel footage of one of the attacks, stating that it shows fighter jets striking a “significant” Hezbollah weapons manufacturing site in the area of Nabi Chit, close to the Syrian border. The IDF also reported having bombed a number of military structures belonging to Hezbollah in the area of Jbaa in southern Lebanon, as well as the group’s infrastructure and outposts in several other areas.According to the Israeli military, the attacks came in response to missiles being fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel overnight in the areas of Kfar Blum and Hanita. No injuries were reported in those strikes.Earlier on Sunday, Hezbollah admitted it had joined in the Iranian drone and missile attack against Israel and twice launched airstrikes towards the occupied Golan Heights. Tehran’s attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian military officials. Tehran has blamed the attack on Israel.Iran-backed Hezbollah, a pro-Palestinian militant group and one of the most influential political factions in Lebanon, has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces since the start of the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza last October.

According to AFP estimates, at least 363 people in Lebanon have been killed in the hostilities so far, including at least 70 civilians, while tens of thousands of people have reportedly fled their homes on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.Hezbollah will only stop its attacks on Israel after a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, emphasising that the front is largely a “supportive” one, the group’s senior politician Hassan Fadlallah said in late February.

        Trump blames Biden for Iranian attack on Israel

    
                    The Republican frontrunner for November’s presidential election has accused the incumbent of showing “unbelievable” weakness
            Donald Trump speaks at a rally outside Schnecksville Fire Hall on April 13, 2024 in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania. ©                 Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden bears part of the blame for Iran’s massive drone and missile strike on Israel on Saturday, former US president and current Republican frontrunner for the November race Donald Trump has claimed. The GOP firebrand suggested that a lack of leadership on the part of the Democratic incumbent has emboldened Tehran.Late on Saturday, Iran launched several waves of missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel. Tehran explained that the strikes were retaliation for the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”What was believed to be an Israeli airstrike destroyed Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.While Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari has reported that the vast majority of the projectiles fired by Iran this weekend were intercepted by air defenses, Iranian state media has claimed that several Israeli military installations were struck.Addressing supporters in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump said that the Iranian strikes took place “because we show great weakness.”

“The weakness that we’ve shown, it’s unbelievable, and it would not have happened if we were in office,” he suggested.He concluded by reiterating his “absolute support” for Israel.Trump has also posted several similar messages on his Truth Social platform, such as one saying: “This should never have been allowed to happen - This would NEVER have happened if I were President!”Trump has previously accused his Democratic rival of not being assertive enough globally and has repeatedly alleged that Biden is unfit for office.An unabashed supporter of Israel, Trump during his time in office recognized Syria’s Golan Heights, which have been occupied for decades, as Israeli territory. He also officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the US embassy there from Tel Aviv in 2018.Speaking on Wednesday in Atlanta, he told reporters that President Biden had “abandoned Israel.”Although continuing to support Israel, Biden has of late been increasingly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign against Hamas.In an interview to MSNBC last month, Biden suggested that the Israeli prime minister was committing a “big mistake” with his hardline approach.Biden pointed out, however, that Washington was “never going to leave Israel” and would keep providing it with weaponry no matter what.

        Israeli military embellishes video of Iranian attack

    
                    The IDF inserted old footage of a Russian Grad missile launch in what was supposed to be a compilation of this weekend’s strikes
            ©                 X/Israel Defense ForcesThe Israeli military appears to have inserted seven-year-old footage of a Russian Grad launch into a purported compilation showing the Iranian missile and drone strikes launched against the Jewish state over the weekend.The video, posted on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption “Israelis’ reality in the last hours,” has raised many eyebrows online.While most fragments of the footage show missiles flying over Israeli territory overnight, the final several seconds have nothing to do with either Israel or Iran but rather appear to be footage of the launch of a Russian Grad rocket system that was posted on YouTube back in 2017.The discrepancy was noticed by X user Mohammed Zubair, who voiced his protest in a post and suggested that the fragment may in fact be as old as 2014.The IDF has not responded to the user’s claim.The last part of the video is as old as 2014. 👋🏽 pic.twitter.com/7BMVRKp82i— Mohammed Zubair (@zoo_bear) April 14, 2024Netizens have been divided on Zubair’s findings, with some praising his fact-checking skills, while others pointed to the fact that the IDF clip is more motivational in nature and does not claim to be official footage.Tehran fired a barrage of more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel overnight on Saturday, according to estimates by the IDF. The attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian military officials. Tehran blamed the attack on Israel.The majority of Iran’s missiles were said to have been shot down before they reached Israeli airspace. However, unverified footage of the airstrikes circulating online purportedly showing several projectiles hitting targets on the ground in Israel.

The Times of Israel reported that West Jerusalem has yet to decide on whether to respond to the Iranian attack or how it would do so. However, Tehran warned Israel earlier against taking any retaliatory measures, as they would be met with a “much more extensive” response.

        Russia tells Israel to condemn Ukraine

    
                    Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made the remark after West Jerusalem’s envoy urged Moscow to denounce Iranian strikes
            Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. ©                 Sputnik/Stanislav KrasilnikovRussia does not feel obliged to condemn Iran’s missile and drone strikes on Israel on Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said. The diplomat explained that West Jerusalem has never denounced Ukraine’s attacks on Russian civilians.According to Israeli estimates, Tehran’s latest show of force involved hundreds of rockets and missiles, as well as kamikaze UAVs. Iran announced that the strike was in response to the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”A presumed Israeli airstrike hit Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.Iranian state media has claimed that a number of Israeli military facilities were struck in Saturday’s attack. The Israeli military, in turn, has insisted that its air defenses shot down nearly all of the incoming projectiles.In a post on her Telegram channel on Sunday, Zakharova addressed the Israeli Ambassador to Russia, Simona Halperin, who had earlier told RIA Novosti that her country expects “our Russian colleagues to condemn the unprecedented Iranian attack on Israeli territory.”

The Israeli envoy also expressed hope that Moscow would counter “Iran’s attempts to destabilize the region.”Zakharova responded: “Simona, remind me of when Israel condemned even a single strike by the Kiev regime on Russian regions? You don’t know? Nor do I.”The foreign ministry representative also cited “regular statements in support of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky’s actions on the part of Israeli officials.”In another statement on Sunday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that Moscow is “deeply concerned with another dangerous escalation in the region.”“We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint. We hope that regional states will solve existing problems through political and diplomatic means,” the ministry added.Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza broke out last October. Israeli authorities claimed that Tehran orchestrated the deadly Hamas incursion that triggered the conflict.Iran has denied involvement, but pledged to keep backing the Palestinian cause.

        Israeli general reveals cost of defending against attack – media

    
                    The operation reportedly required upward of $1.3 billion worth of interceptor missiles and other materials to bring down Iran’s aerial barrages
            ©                 Sara Lemel/picture alliance via Getty ImagesIsrael has claimed success in defending itself against Saturday’s drone and missile barrages by Iran, but that effort reportedly came at a high price.The interceptors, jet fuel and other materials expended in shooting down Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles cost about 4-to-5 billion shekels ($1.06 billion to $1.33 billion), Israeli Brigadier General Reem Aminoach told local media outlet Ynet News on Sunday. The estimate included only Israel’s direct costs, not counting the considerable weaponry used by the US and other allies in helping to defend against the attack.Aminoach, formerly the financial adviser to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff, said West Jerusalem used such munitions as Arrow and David’s Sling interceptor missiles, which have per-unit costs of about $3.5 million and $1 million, respectively. He also included sortie expenses for the fighter jets that did the bulk of the work in shooting down Iranian drones.

The general lamented that it was far cheaper for Iran to launch the attack than for Israel to defend itself. “The attack cost Iran less than 10% of what it cost us to defend against it,” he told Ynet. “In the future – in a year, two years, or five years – they can carry out 50 such attacks. And let’s say that if the IDF’s net budget in 2023 was 60 billion shekels, with less than double that you have no chance of reaching a situation where we can maintain the required amounts.”The IDF claimed that 99% of the more than 300 kamikaze drones and missiles launched from Iranian territory were successfully intercepted. All of the UAVs and cruise missiles were shot down, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said, while a few ballistic missiles got through Israel’s defenses.Those projectiles fell at the Nevatim Airbase and caused “only minor damage to infrastructure,” the spokesman said. He added that the drones launched by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and Yemen all failed to reach Israeli territory. The only casualty was a shrapnel wound to a 10-year-old Bedouin Israeli girl who was hit while sleeping at her home in southern Israel.

        Netanyahu called off retaliation strikes after speaking to Biden – NYT

    
                    The US president reportedly talked the Israeli prime minister out of military action against Iran
            Joe Biden (L) meets with Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023 ©                 AFP / Brendan SmialowskiIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a plan to launch immediate retaliatory strikes against Iran after speaking to US President Joe Biden by phone on Saturday night, Israeli officials have told the New York Times.According to two anonymous officials, Netanyahu’s war cabinet presented him with a list of responses to a massive drone and missile attack by Iran on Saturday evening. While some members of the cabinet reportedly pushed for an immediate military response, Netanyahu ultimately chose not to follow their advice at Biden’s request, the sources said.The full details of Biden’s conversation with Netanyahu were not revealed by the White House. According to a report on Sunday by Axios, however, Biden told Netanyahu that Israel had essentially prevailed in this clash with Iran and advised him to “take the win.” It was also made clear during the call that any retaliatory action by Israel would not be supported by Washington, the American outlet reported.

‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran



Netanyahu’s war cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to discuss Israel’s response to the Iranian attack, while Iran’s top military commander declared that the “Zionist regime” had been adequately “punished,” and that Tehran would not pursue further military action unless Israel struck again.Iran launched multiple waves of missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel on Saturday, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stating that at least 300 projectiles were fired. While the IDF claimed to have shot down 99% of the incoming drones and missiles, video footage showed numerous impacts on Israeli soil.Iranian officials insisted that they had “more success than expected” with the barrage, and claimed that two Israeli bases had been destroyed. The IDF acknowledged only minor damage to one military facility.

The attack came two weeks after an alleged Israeli airstrike hit an Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus. The strike killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Tehran telegraphed its response, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning for over a week that Israel could expect a “slap in the face.”

        Iran is ‘greatest threat’ to world order – Israel

    
                    West Jerusalem has called for “painful sanctions” in response to Saturday’s drone and missile barrages
            Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz speaks at a UN Security Council meeting last month in New York.  © Getty Images /                 John LamparskiThe Israeli Foreign Ministry has responded to Saturday’s Iranian attack by condemning Tehran as the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace.Iran should be hit with “painful sanctions,” as well as designation of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, following the overnight attack, the ministry said on Sunday in a statement. Tehran launched hundreds of suicide drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an April 1 airstrike that killed seven IRGC officers at the Iranian consulate in Damascus.“Iran launched a large-scale and unprecedented attack against the state of Israel, which included hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles,” the Foreign Ministry said. “This attack once again proves what Israel has been saying for years: Iran is behind terrorist attacks in the region and is also the greatest threat to regional stability and world order, which is why Iran should never acquire nuclear weapons.”New sanctions against Iran should not be limited to the country’s missile industry, the ministry said. “Iran must pay the price for its aggression, and the first step in this direction must be immediate recognition of the Iranian IRGC – which carried out this large-scale terrorist attack against Israel – as a terrorist organization.”

Netanyahu called off retaliation strikes after speaking to Biden – NYT



Foreign Minister Israel Katz resuscitated an old phrase coined by former US President George W. Bush to express his outrage, saying, “The entire free world must stand with Israel against the axis of Iranian evil.”Israel may be trying to use a diplomatic offensive to punish Iran after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly urged by US President Joe Biden to cancel retaliatory strikes against Tehran. At Biden’s request, Netanyahu chose to reject calls from some members of his war cabinet for an immediate military response, the New York Times reported, citing two unidentified Israeli officials.Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN justified Saturday’s attack by citing its legitimate right of self-defense under Article 51 of the global body’s charter. “The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said in a statement, referring to the retribution for Israel’s strike against its Damascus consulate.Tehran has no intention of taking further action, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for Iran’s military, said on Sunday. However, he warned that if Israel strikes again in response to Saturday’s attack, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

The Israeli military claimed that 99% of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched from Iranian territory were successfully intercepted. The few that got through Israel’s defenses caused only minor infrastructure damage at the Nevatim Airbase. Only one person, a ten-year-old Bedouin Israeli girl, was injured.

Iranian attack on Israel

        Zelensky backs Israel

    
                    The Ukrainian president has likened Iran’s tactics to those of Russia, accusing Tehran of threatening the Middle East
            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ©                 PETRAS MALUKAS / AFPUkrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has condemned Iran’s missile and drone strikes against Israel on Saturday, drawing parallels between Tehran’s actions and Russia’s tactics in Ukraine.Iran said the barrage was in retaliation for the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”A presumed Israeli airstrike destroyed Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.According to Iranian state media, Saturday’s strikes hit a number of Israeli military facilities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that its air defenses intercepted nearly all of the incoming projectiles.In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, President Zelensky wrote that “Ukraine condemns Iran’s attack on Israel.” The Ukrainian head of state added that his compatriots “know very well the horror of similar attacks by Russia, which uses the same Shahed drones and Russian missiles, the same tactics of mass air strikes.”

Kiev and its Western backers have repeatedly claimed that Iran has been providing Russia with its kamikaze UAVs, and that Moscow has begun producing them under license. Russia has never confirmed these allegations.Iran, however, did acknowledge in November 2022 that it had supplied Moscow with a “small number” of drones a few months before Russia began its operation in Ukraine.In his latest statement, Zelensky accused Iran of posing a threat to the Middle East, claiming that there is “obvious collaboration” between Tehran and Moscow.According to the Ukrainian leader, Iranian strikes on Israel on Saturday should serve as a “wake-up call to the free world,” which needs to deliver a “resolute and united response.”In a thinly veiled reference to the political deadlock in the US that has seen Republican lawmakers block President Joe Biden’s foreign defense aid package for months now, Zelensky urged the US Congress to “make the necessary decisions to strengthen America’s allies at this critical time.”Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry expressed concern over “another dangerous escalation in the region” and urged “all parties involved to exercise restraint.”Responding to a call by Israel’s ambassador in Russia, Simona Halperin, to condemn Tehran’s actions, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova pointed out that Israel has never once denounced Ukrainian strikes targeting Russian civilians.On the contrary, Israeli officials have repeatedly expressed support for Kiev, the diplomat noted, suggesting that Moscow therefore has no reason to stick up for Israel.

        Western demands for UN to discuss Iran attack are ‘hypocrisy’ – Moscow

    
                    Failure to condemn the Israeli bombing of Tehran’s consulate in Syria spurred the latest violence, Russia’s ambassador has argued
            Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia ©                 Lev Radin / Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty ImagesThe UN Security Council helped give rise to Saturday’s Iranian attack against Israel by hypocritically failing to take action over the illegal bombing that provoked the latest violence in the region, Russia’s ambassador to the global body has claimed.“What happened on the night of April 14 did not happen in a vacuum,” Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told members of the UN Security Council on Sunday. “The steps undertaken by Iran became a reaction to the disgraceful inaction by this council.”At issue was the April 1 missile strike that killed seven Iranian military officers, including two senior commanders, at Tehran’s consulate in Damascus. Western members of the Security Council stood in the way of rebuking Israel over the “egregious attack,” despite the fact that it was a violation of international law on the inviolability of diplomatic installations, the Russian envoy said.“We called on UN Security Council colleagues to clearly and unequivocally condemn such reckless steps to make sure that they don’t get repeated,” Nebenzia noted. “We also warned that otherwise, the risk of a repeat of such acts and a general escalation in the region would grow manifold.” He added, “The outcome is now clear for everyone to see.”

Iran launched hundreds of suicide drones and missiles against Israel on Saturday night. West Jerusalem claimed success in intercepting 99% of the barrages and preventing major casualties or infrastructure damage.The Israeli Foreign Ministry responded by calling for “painful sanctions” against Iran, as well as the designation of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. An emergency UN Security Council session was convened to discuss the attack.Nebenzia contrasted the council’s concern over protecting Western nations and their allies with its inaction when Israel bombed Iran’s consulate. “We know very well that an attack against a diplomatic representation is a casus belli under international law. And if a Western representation had been hit, you would immediately have rained down reprisals.”

However, he added, “when it comes to other countries, their rights – including the right to self-defense – well, that’s a different matter, as you like to say… What we’re witnessing is a display of hypocrisy and double standards that is almost embarrassing to watch.”The US, UK, and France essentially declined to confirm that the basic principles of international law concerning diplomatic facilities apply equally to all states, Nebenzia said. At the same time, Israel has faced no consequences for disregarding UN resolutions, including last month’s demand for a ceasefire in Gaza.“We think it’s urgent for the entire international community to undertake all efforts necessary to deescalate the situation,” the ambassador said. “Otherwise, the region could be drawn into a vicious cycle of mutual attacks and violence.”

        Middle East on verge of full-scale war – UN

    
                    Antonio Guterres has condemned both the bombing of the Iranian consulate and Tehran’s retaliation against Israel
            UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at an emergency UNSC session, New York, April 14, 2024. ©                 UN Photo/Eskinder DebebeUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged for maximum restraint, warning that the entire Middle East is on the brink of a full-scale war in the wake of Iran’s drone and missile strike on Israel this weekend.The attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month, which killed seven members of Iran’s military, including two generals. Tehran accused West Jerusalem of conducting an extraterritorial assassination. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel strikes its “enemies all over the Middle East,” two days after the April 1 consulate strike.The entire region is facing a devastating conflict after these events, Guterres warned. “Now is the time to defuse and deescalate,” he said, urging “maximum restraint.”

While he “strongly condemned” the large-scale attack on Israel, he also reiterated his condemnation of the bombing of Tehran’s consular buildings in Damascus earlier this month, calling for an “immediate cessation of these hostilities.”It’s time to step back from the brink. It’s vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East.Guterres also urged for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, where over 33,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes over the past six months, according to local health officials. West Jerusalem declared war and vowed to annihilate the Gaza-based militant group Hamas after it conducted a surprise raid on Israeli soil, killing more than 1,100 people and taking around 250 hostages. The UN has previously warned that the deteriorating humanitarian situation and inadequate flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza is leading to starvation among the displaced civilian population of the enclave.

The UN chief called for the unconditional release of all hostages, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and the reestablishment of safe navigation in the Red Sea, which is currently hampered by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The group has been attacking shipping in the region in solidarity with the Palestinians, vowing to continue until the Gaza siege is broken.With “regional and indeed global peace and security” undermined, Guterres said, “neither the region nor the world can afford more war.”

        Israel shows aftermath of Iranian attack on airbase (VIDEO)

    
                    Only a few of more than 300 projectiles launched by Tehran made it through Israeli defenses, the IDF has said
            © YouTube /                 Youtube /  עדכוני צה""לThe Iranian airstrikes on Israel at the weekend caused only minor damage to one military base, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has claimed, releasing footage purporting to show repair work at the facility.Tehran launched a series of airstrikes against Israel over the weekend, in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria earlier this month. West Jerusalem has not commented on the consular attack, although Tehran has accused it of assassinating several of its high-ranking military personnel.Of the roughly 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles launched from Iran at the weekend, only a few made it through the combined air defenses of Israel and its allies, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press release on Sunday.The ballistic missiles that breached Israeli defenses dealt “only minor damage to the infrastructure at the Nevatim base,” the IDF wrote on its website, posting footage purporting to show the damage and subsequent repair work.“The function of Nevatim base was not affected, the planes continued to take off and land and fulfill the defense and attack missions,” it added.

As many as nine missiles penetrated Israeli defenses, ABC News wrote, citing a senior US official. Five ballistic missiles hit the Nevatim Airbase and damaged a C-130 transport plane, a runway and empty storage facilities, the channel said. Four more missiles hit the Negev Airbase, although no significant damage was done, the official told ABC.Iranian media, however, claimed the strikes destroyed “important military targets,” and published multiple videos purporting to show missiles penetrating Israeli air defenses. Tehran is satisfied with the outcome and has no intention of continuing the operation, chief of staff of the armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, said. He warned that if Israel retaliates, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

        Israel weighing response to Iranian attack – IDF

    
                    Countermeasures could involve a “strike or no strike,” a military spokesperson had said, according to ABC
            Israeli war cabinet meeting, Tel Aviv, Israel, April 14, 2024  © Getty Images /                 Israeli Ministry of Defense / Handout/Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe Israeli military has presented a range of options to the government on how to respond to the recent Iranian airstrikes, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Peter Lerner told journalists on Monday, as reported by ABC news.  Tehran launched several waves of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles at Israel over the weekend, in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. The strike on the consulate – which West Jerusalem has neither confirmed nor denied – killed seven members of the Iranian military, including two high-ranking generals.  Iran has said its retaliatory operation destroyed two Israeli military bases, although the IDF claimed it intercepted 99% of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched at the country, admitting only “minor damage” to Nevatim Airbase.

“Just because we were successful in intercepting, we should not underestimate what Iran did,” Lerner said. The Israeli government is “currently reviewing the options” after the “IDF has presented what it believes could be done,” ABC quoted the spokesman as saying. The response could entail a “strike or no strike” Lerner stated, adding that the government could make a decision as early as Monday.  Despite “emotions running high” among the Israeli leadership following the airstrikes, US President Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to show restraint in an effort to avoid further military escalation, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing a senior administration official. Iran has warned that a military response would prompt an even bigger escalation. Tehran sees its airstrikes as a success and has “no intention of continuing the operation,” Iran’s chief of staff of the armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, announced on Sunday. He warned that if Israel responds with force, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

Iranian attack on Israel

        Iranian media names weapons used to strike Israel (VIDEO, PHOTOS)

    
                    The attack reportedly relied heavily on Shahed-136 drones and several types of advanced long-range missiles
            A handout picture provided by Iran's Defence Ministry on May 25, 2023, shows the testing of the fourth generation Khorramshahr ballistic missile. ©                 IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY / AFPIran used kamikaze drones and several types of long-range ballistic missiles to launch a wave of strikes on Israel over the weekend, local media has reported.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran’s powerful attack on Israel involved 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles. The strikes came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, early this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead.While the Iranian military provided few details about what weapons were used in the attack, local media suggested that it employed many of its advanced systems to target its arch-enemy.According to Press TV, the drone and missile raid was preceded by cyberattacks on Israel’s radar and power grid systems, causing outages.The outlet, along with Mehr News agency, said that the air attack involved dozens Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. The aircraft, which has also been characterized as a loitering munition, has delta-shaped wings and is difficult for radars to detect due to its low signature. It has a range of 2,000km and can carry a payload of up to 50kg.The drone swarms were apparently followed by several types of missiles. Press TV reported that Iran likely used an unknown number of Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles with a payload of half a ton.

Meanwhile, Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iran’s military at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, argued that the strike also included Paveh 351 cruise missiles with a range of 1,650km.The New York Times reported the weapons used by Iran in the attack were much faster and more precise than those used by the Palestinian armed movement Hamas, which often relies on inaccurate missiles made of inferior materials.

However, Iran and Israel disagreed sharply on the results of the strike. While Iranian officials have said that the attack was even more successful than expected, claiming to have destroyed two Israeli bases, West Jerusalem insists that 99% of incoming targets were shot down.

        Israel mobilizes more reservists

    
                    Two additional brigades are being called up to fight in Gaza, the military has said
            FILE PHOTO: Israeli troops at the Gaza border. ©                 Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesIsrael will mobilize two additional brigades for operations in Gaza, the military announced on Sunday.More reservists are needed on the front line “to defend the State of Israel and ensure the security of its citizens,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.The announcement came a week after Israel pulled most of its ground forces out of the Palestinian enclave, in what the military leadership described as preparation for a mission in the city of Rafah.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure from his coalition partners to send ground troops into the city on the Egyptian border, where some 1.3 million Palestinians are estimated to be crammed. The US, a key supplier of military aid to Israel, has expressed concerns that an operation in Rafah would cause significant civilian casualties.

Members of the Israeli government, including Netanyahu, have maintained the Jewish state cannot achieve its primary stated goal of defeating the Palestinian militant group Hamas without entering Rafah.The announcement on Sunday came after Western assistance helped Israeli forces repel a barrage of Iranian drones and missiles. Tehran launched the attack in retaliation for an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus on April 1, which it blamed on Israel. The IDF claimed that together with its partners, it had had stopped some 99% of Iranian projectiles.Commenting on the Iranian attack, IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stressed that the Israeli military “has not lost sight” of its goals in Gaza. “Hamas and Iran want to ignite the Middle East and escalate the region,” he claimed.The ongoing hostilities in Gaza were triggered by a Hamas incursion into southern Israel in October, in which some 1,200 people were killed and dozens taken hostage. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed amid the Israeli retaliation, most of them women and children, according to local health authorities.

        China comments on Iran-Israel tensions

    
                    The “flames” of Israel’s war with Hamas are threatening to engulf the entire Middle East, Beijing’s ambassador to the UN has said

 
            China's deputy permanent representative to the U.N. Dai Bing. ©                 AP Photo/Yuki IwamuraIran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel constitute an “adverse spillover” of the Gaza conflict, China’s ambassador to the United Nations has said, warning that it could spread further and make the entire Middle East even more unstable.Dai Bing made the remarks after Tehran launched a series of airstrikes on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria, which killed seven military personnel, including two generals.Israel has not commented on the incident since Iran accused it of conducting an extraterritorial assassination.Speaking at a UN Security Council emergency meeting on Sunday, Dai condemned Israel’s “vicious attack,” which he described as a “grave violation of the UN Charter and international law, and a breach of the sovereignty of both Syria and Iran.”The war in Gaza “bears on the peace, stability and long-term security in the [Middle East] region,” he added, and called for an immediate end to the hostilities.Dai warned that if “the flames of the Gaza conflict are allowed to continue raging, the adverse spillover is set to spread still further” across the entire region.The Chinese envoy also called for “maximum calm and restraint” from Israel and Iran to prevent further escalations.

“Ultimately, there is no alternative to the full implementation of the two-state solution, the only way to end the vicious circle of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict once and for all,” Dai said.China has called on the international community, particularly countries with influence, to play a “constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” the ambassador added.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also warned at Sunday’s emergency meeting that the entire Middle East is on the brink of a full-scale war in the wake of Iran’s strike on Israel.Meanwhile, Russia’s ambassador to the global body, Vassily Nebenzia, told members of the UN Security Council that the retaliatory strike “did not happen in a vacuum.” He claimed that the West had helped give rise to Iran’s attack by failing to take action over the illegal bombing of Tehran’s consulate in Damascus that provoked the latest violence in the region.

        No Biden address on Israel-Iran escalation – Politico

    
                    The US president is keeping a “low profile” to discourage tensions, his aides have told the news outlet
            FILE PHOTO: US President Joe Biden. ©                 Anna Moneymaker / Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has avoided making a public statement on the Iranian attack on Israel at the weekend in a bid to reduce tensions and stave off potential domestic criticism over the Gaza war, Politico has reported.Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday, declaring it was “punishing” the Jewish state for striking Tehran’s consulate in Damascus earlier this month. Israel, which did not publicly claim credit for killing Iranian officers at the diplomatic compound, has claimed that along with its partners, it repelled some 99% of Iranian weapons.The US was among the nations to help defend Israel and has pledged continued support, although Biden did not comment publicly at the weekend in an effort to discourage further escalation in the Middle East, White House officials told Politico.“Putting the president behind the Resolute Desk turns up the temperature,” one source said. “That’s something to ideally avoid.”

Some Biden advisers hope that the Iranian attack could grant them a temporary reprieve from Democratic critics, who disagree with Washington’s response to the hostilities with Gaza, the report added. Israel launched a massive military operation in the Palestinian enclave in retaliation for an incursion by the militant movement Hamas last October which left more than 1,200 people dead.Pro-Palestinian voices in the US, particularly from younger and progressive voters, have accused Biden of failing to keep Israel in check. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 33,000 as a result of Israel’s bombardment, according to local health officials.Members of Biden’s reelection team are concerned that voter discontent could cost him swing states such as Michigan during the November election, Politico said. Over 100,000 people voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary race in the state in February, following a campaign to show the incumbent leader their anger with his Israel policy.

        Iran-Israel escalation is avoidable – Hungary

    
                    Budapest has said major global players must behave “responsibly” and assist in easing the tensions
            Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.  © Getty Images /                 AnadoluIt is possible to avoid a further escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote in a post on Facebook late on Sunday.Tehran launched a massive airstrike on Israel on Saturday in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement that Israel strikes “enemies all over the Middle East.” Iran has warned that Israel reacting militarily to its strikes would prompt an even bigger escalation, while West Jerusalem is reportedly weighing its options.Szijjarto said he had discussed the situation with his Russian and Emirati counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, late on Sunday.“Based on our discussions, I see that we Hungarians are not the only ones eager to prevent the spread of the Middle East conflict… There is still a chance that a widespread escalation of the situation can be avoided. However, this will only be possible if all significant players in world politics behave responsibly in the coming period,” he stated.In a separate post, Szijjarto said that Budapest “strongly condemns” Iran’s missile attack on Israel, as it “threatens to escalate the conflict,” posing a serious threat to global security. He expressed those sentiments in a conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Sunday. He also said he made clear to his counterpart that Hungary opposes any further ramp up of tensions.

Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN justified Saturday’s barrage as self-defense under Article 51 of the body’s charter. Tehran also said it has no intention of taking further action unless Israel strikes it again. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, however, condemned Tehran as the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace and called for “painful sanctions” against Iran, as well as the designation of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.

        ‘Time to be smart’ – UK on Israel-Iran tensions

    
                    British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he hoped there would be no “retaliatory response” to Iran’s attack
            UK Foreign Secretary and former Prime Minister David Cameron. ©                 Antonio Masiello/Getty ImagesIsrael has every right to retaliate after the Iranian drone and missile attack over the weekend but would be better served by refraining from an escalation, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said. The Iranian strikes, which Israeli officials say involved around 300 drones and missiles of various types, came in response to the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria earlier this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead. Iran believes that Israel was behind the strike, although West Jerusalem has neither claimed nor denied responsibility.In an interview with Sky News on Monday, Cameron, who served as UK prime minister between 2010 and 2016 and was appointed foreign secretary last year, described the Iranian strike as a “double defeat.” He argued that the attack “was almost a total failure, and they’ve revealed to the world that they are the malign influence in the region.”

Pointing to the scale of the attack, Cameron remarked: “Of course if you’re sitting in Israel this morning you’re thinking quite rightly – ‘We have every right to respond to this’… But we are urging that they shouldn’t escalate.”“I totally understand those in Israel who want to see more, but I think this is a time to think with head as well as heart and to be smart as well as tough,” he argued.Cameron added that he hoped there would be no “retaliatory response,” and that the world would shift its focus back to Hamas and the hostages that had been captured by the Palestinian armed group after it attacked Israel last year.Israeli officials claimed that the military shot down 99% of the incoming Iranian drones and missiles and that the attack did “only minor damage to the infrastructure at the Nevatim base.” Air force operations in the area were not affected, the officials added. Iran, however, has insisted that the barrage was more successful than expected, claiming that “important military targets” had been destroyed, and that Nevatim air base was rendered inoperable. Tehran said that it had no intention of continuing the attacks but warned Israel of a harsh response if it were to retaliate.CNN, citing sources, reported that Israel has so far made no decision on how to respond. One of the network’s sources noted that an Israeli official told the US that his country was not looking to escalate the standoff.

        Macron calls for ‘isolation’ of Iran

    
                    The French president has condemned Tehran’s attack on Israel and called for sanctions to be strengthened
            French President Emmanuel Macron.  © Getty Images /                 Christian Liewig - CorbisFrench President Emmanuel Macron has called for international sanctions on Iran to be strengthened following its attack on Israel over the weekend.Tehran carried out a massive airstrike on Israeli territory on Saturday in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its role in the bombing, but its responsibility was later implied by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.In an interview to BFMTV and RMC radio, Macron condemned Iran’s response, calling it “disproportionate.”“Instead of targeting Israeli interests outside Israel, [Tehran] went after Israel on its soil, and attacked from their own soil, which is a first,” he said, noting that the airstrikes had caused “a profound rupture” in already strained relations between the two Middle Eastern states, paving the way for further “dangerous reactions” on both sides.Macron said the international community “will do everything to avoid escalation” in the conflict and urged Israel not to retaliate via military means. Instead, he said the focus should be on “isolating“ Iran and called for more sanctions on Tehran, including “boosting pressure on its nuclear activities,” which he believes would help “find a path to peace in the region.”Iran has justified Saturday’s attack by citing its right of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also pledged not to take further action, unless Israel strikes again, but warned that a military response from would prompt an even bigger escalation. Israel has called Iran the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace, and called for “painful sanctions” on Tehran, including its nuclear industry.

Iran has been the subject of various international sanctions for decades amid fears in the West that its nuclear enrichment program was aimed at producing a nuclear bomb. Sanctions were eased somewhat in 2015 when Tehran agreed to some restrictions on the program under the Iran Nuclear Deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran, the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the EU.However, the deal was scuppered in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and reimposed old sanctions on Tehran. Several attempts to revive the deal in recent years have proven unsuccessful.

        Iran calls on India to continue efforts to stop Gaza war

    
                    The two countries’ foreign ministers discussed the situation after Tehran launched its first direct attack on Israel
            Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian meets his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Tehran, Iran on January 15, 2024. ©                 Haydar Sahin/Getty ImagesIran has urged India to maintain an “active role” in efforts to halt the war in Gaza through international bodies, such as the United Nations Security Council. Discussing Tehran’s retaliatory attack on West Jerusalem with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian stressed “the imperative of ending the aggression and crimes committed by the Zionist regime.” Jaishankar spoke to his counterpart in Tehran following Iran’s drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an April 1 airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel’s attack killed several high-profile officers of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force.During his call with the Iranian foreign minister, Jaishakar stressed the importance of de-escalating and asked the parties “to assume responsibility and work towards a peaceful resolution.” In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s attack, New Delhi issued a statement calling for “immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence, and return to the path of diplomacy.”The diplomats also discussed the fate of the Indian crew members of the Israeli-operated vessel MSC Aries, which was seized by Iran in the Persian Gulf last week. Tehran has said it will allow New Delhi officials to meet the 17 sailors.

The Indian leadership has advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict while calling for both sides to engage in talks.Last October, India abstained on a UN General Assembly resolution that called for a truce as it did not mention Hamas’ attack. In December, however, New Delhi voted in favor of a resolution that demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages. Earlier this month, India abstained on a proposal at the UN’s Human Rights Council to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. India’s push for de-escalation in the region stems from strategic, economic, and humanitarian concerns, Indian Express noted in a report. Around 18,000 Indians live in Israel and about 5,000-10,000 in Iran. At the same time, the number of Indians living, working, and studying in the Gulf countries exceeds nine million people, and a large-scale conflict could disrupt the lives of the diaspora.Moreover, the Middle East accounts for about 80% of India’s oil supplies, and a conflict could send energy prices soaring.

A regional war might also derail two ambitious transportation corridors that New Delhi considers vital for expanding its trade with Europe, Central Asia, and Russia. These are the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) connecting India with Russia and the CIS region via Iran – bypassing volatile parts of the Middle East – and the proposed India-Middle-East-Europe Economic corridor (EMEC) connecting India via the ports of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.  Where India Meets Russia – We are now on WhatsApp! ‎Follow and share RT India in English and in Hindi

        Kremlin comments on Iran’s strike on Israel

    
                    Moscow has urged both sides to exercise restraint, warning that escalation will benefit no one
            ©                 Alexander NEMENOV / AFPNo one would benefit from a conflict between Iran and Israel spiraling out of control, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, voicing hope that the two regional powers will be able to resolve their differences peacefully.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Peskov weighed in on a massive Iranian strike on Israel over the weekend, which West Jerusalem said involved more than 300 drones and missiles. The attack came in response to an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month. The strike killed several senior Iranian military personnel.The Kremlin spokesman said that Russia is “extremely worried about escalating tensions in the region,” urging everyone to exercise restraint.“Further escalation serves no one’s interests. We advocate that all differences be resolved only by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov added.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has also said that regional tensions are being fueled by “the unresolved nature of numerous crises in the Middle East, primarily in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone.”It also deplored that the UN Security Council had been unable to “adequately react” to the bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria – which Iran insists was the reason for its strike in the first place – due to the stance of Western powers on the issue.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected Israel’s call to condemn Iran’s attack, saying that West Jerusalem had not denounced Ukrainian strikes on Russian regions, and that it regularly provides vocal diplomatic support for Kiev.In the aftermath of the barrage, Iran declared the end of its military operation against Israel, warning the Jewish state of harsh pushback if it were to retaliate.Numerous reports indicate that the US wants Israel to exercise caution, which has yet to make a decision on whether to respond. CNN reported, citing an Israeli official, that Netanyahu’s government told the US it is not looking to significantly escalate the situation. However, according to Reuters, the Israeli war cabinet favors retaliation but is divided over its timing and scope.
