But analysts say that Iran likely will launch its own attack, raising fears of a regional war and showing the limits of US deterrence efforts in the Middle East.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Israel’s war on Gaza: List of key events, day 189list 2 of 3Will dissent in DC make a difference in Israel’s war on Gaza?list 3 of 3Journalist loses foot after being badly wounded in Israeli attack in Gazaend of list
The brinkmanship and resulting tensions have put further strain on Washington’s foreign policy. Already, the US is caught between two seemingly conflicting priorities: offering unconditional support for Israel and preventing the conflict in Gaza from expanding.
“Biden is doubling down on a formula that so far has been absolutely disastrous,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy.
Parsi said Biden should have rebuked Israel for attacking the Iranian embassy on April 1, violating international law and endangering US troops in the region.
But, he explained, the Biden administration is rewarding the Israeli government by promising to support it instead.
The US — unlike some of its Arab and Western allies — has not condemned the Israeli strike on the Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria, which killed seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including two generals.
The White House, however, was quick to distance itself from the strike, stressing that the US was not involved in it.
 



 
US ‘devoted’ to Israel’s defence
US diplomats have reportedly been working the phones this week, speaking with their counterparts across the world to urge restraint from Iran.
While calling for de-escalation, US officials have also reaffirmed their country’s “ironclad” support for Israel, raising fears of a direct confrontation between Washington and Tehran.
“We are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed,” Biden said on Friday. The Pentagon and State Department have also expressed similar positions.
“This completely deprives Israel of any incentives to de-escalate,” Parsi said.
He added that Biden’s backing of Israel mirrors his “bear hug” approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the outset of the war on Gaza, which gave a green light to the mass killings and rights violations in the Palestinian territory.
“That helped shape Israel’s strategy that knew no limits, that did not care about international law — because they had come to understand that Biden will support them no matter what,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.
Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy think tank, called the US approach to the crisis “hypocritical and contradictory”.
“They’re calling on all the other parties in the region to be restrained, constantly telling the Iranians ‘don’t escalate’, whereas they encourage Israelis to act with total impunity,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.
Iran says Israel ‘must be punished’
He added that the Iranian pledge to retaliate is partly driven by the perception that the US and Israel believe they can cause harm without triggering a strong reaction from Tehran, which does not want a regional war.
But now Iran wants to draw a firm line, Toossi told Al Jazeera. “It can very objectively be stated that US policy has gotten us into this situation.”
 



 
The Israeli military has been targeting Iran-linked sites in Syria for years, as Tehran bolsters its military presence in the war-torn country.
But experts say Tehran saw bombing a diplomatic facility as a particularly brazen act that should not go unanswered.
“The consulate and embassy offices in any country are considered to be the territory of that country. When they attack our consulate, it means they have attacked our territory,” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday.
“The Zionist regime made a mistake and must be punished and will be punished.”
It remains to be seen where and how that promised punishment will come, but if it happens, it could be a turning point in the expanding Gaza conflict. Several countries have warned their citizens this week against travelling to the region.
The war on Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, has already expanded beyond the narrow enclave.
Iran-allied Lebanese group Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces daily. The Houthis have been firing missiles and drones at Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea, demanding an end to the war, and a US-led coalition has been targeting the Yemeni group to stem its attacks.
But the trend towards regional escalation appeared to have subsided somewhat after Iraqi armed groups halted their attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria — at the request of Tehran, according to several media reports.
A drone attack by Iran-backed Iraqi groups had killed three US soldiers at a base near the Jordan-Syria border. The US had then retaliated with a series of strikes in Iraq and Syria, but the crisis was eventually contained.
‘Pressure’ on US and Israel
Now the region is once again staring at the prospect of a widened conflict.
“The pressure is now on Israel and the US rather than Iran. And yes, there are a lot of threatening remarks directed at Iran in the hope that the Iranians don’t act. But the die was first cast by Israel,” said Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs at John Hopkins University.
“And now people are trying to avoid what might be consequences.”
Biden does not want the US to be pulled into a war with Iran, particularly as he seeks reelection in November. But Washington’s default policy has long been to support Israel, Nasr added.
“The American position is that they don’t want the war to expand. They don’t want to be dragged into a war with Iran. They don’t want the Gaza war to become a regional war,” he told Al Jazeera.
“They may be saying things to Israel behind the scenes, but I think publicly they’re trying to warn Iran not to escalate the war as well.”
But he added that every country has to contend with domestic politics in its foreign policy. “And in the United States, giving ironclad guarantees to Israel’s defence is already a given.”
In Washington, Iran hawks are urging a forceful American response if Israel is attacked.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton called on Wednesday for “joint American-Israeli retaliation” that would be “swift and devastating” to any Iranian military move against Israel.

Israel is under threat of imminent attack by Iran. President Biden needs to warn the ayatollahs immediately that the United States will back Israel to the hilt and the joint American-Israeli retaliation for any attack will be swift and devastating.
— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) April 11, 2024

‘Obvious de-escalatory path’
Ryan Costello, policy director at the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a Washington, DC-based group that favours US diplomacy with Iran, warned that if the US joins Israel in reprisal strikes, the results could be catastrophic.
“It’s really reckless and would certainly plunge the entire region into a disastrous and bloody conflict,” he told Al Jazeera.
Costello said the US posture so far has been heavy on deterrence and light on de-confliction.
“They’re saying Israel is going to have our backing, and Iran should just accept the strike on a diplomatic compound, which I think would be hard for any nation to accept,” he said.
For his part, Parsi of the Quincy Institute stressed that the best remedy to the simmering tensions across the Middle East is ending the war in Gaza.
“In the broader picture, there has of course been an obvious de-escalatory path that has always been available to Biden, and that is to push for a ceasefire in Gaza,” Parsi said.
“A ceasefire would have stopped the attacks by Iraqi militias on the US, would have stopped the Houthi attacks, would have stopped the escalation between Iran and Israel and Israel and Hezbollah.”

The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs on Friday advised its citizens against travelling to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories.
In a statement on the social media platform X, the ministry added that relatives of Iran-based diplomats will return to France and French civil servants are now banned from conducting any missions in the countries and territories in question.
The UK told its citizens to avoid all but essential travel to Israel and Palestine over the “possibility of an attack on Israeli territory from Iran”.
In an update, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned against “all travel” to northern Israel, the Gaza Strip, areas near Gaza and the occupied West Bank – excluding occupied East Jerusalem and Route 1 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
 



 
Russia strongly recommended its citizens “refrain from travelling to the region”, emphasising security risks in Israel, Lebanon and Palestine.
“The situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone as well as in the area of the ‘Blue Line’ between Lebanon and Israel remains unstable,” its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
Poland’s Foreign Ministry also advised against travel to Israel, Palestine and Lebanon.
“It cannot be ruled out that there will be a sudden escalation of military operations, which would cause significant difficulties in leaving these three countries,” it said in a statement. “Any escalation may lead to significant restrictions in air traffic and the inability to cross land border crossings.”
India’s statement covered Iran and Israel, calling on Indians not to go to the two countries until further notice in view of the “prevailing situation in the region”.
The Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi said Indian citizens who are in the two countries should observe “utmost precautions about their safety and restrict their movements to the minimum”.
Germany meanwhile warned its citizens to leave Iran specifically, saying escalating tensions could affect exit routes.
“In the current tensions, especially between Israel and Iran, there is a risk of a sudden escalation,” the Foreign Office said. “German citizens are at concrete risk of being arbitrarily arrested and interrogated and being given long prison sentences. Dual citizens with Iranian and German nationality are especially at risk,” it added.
Separately, German flagship airline Lufthansa extended its suspension of flights to and from Tehran until Thursday and will not use Iranian airspace during that time.
 



 
Real and viable threat, US says
The United States has restricted its employees in Israel and their family members from personal travel outside the greater Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheba areas.
An imminent attack by Iran on Israel is a “real” and “viable” threat, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists on Friday, adding that Washington would make sure the Israelis “have what they need and that they’re able to defend themselves”.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, President Joe Biden said: “We are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed.”
The top US commander for the Middle East, General Erik Kurilla, is also in Israel for talks with its military officials on security threats. His trip was moved up from a previously scheduled date “due to recent developments”, Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said on Thursday.
After Kurilla discussed the tensions with Iran with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday, Gallant said the US and Israel were “shoulder to shoulder” in facing possible threats.
“We are prepared to defend ourselves on the ground and in the air, in close cooperation with our partners, and we will know how to respond,” the defence chief added.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting a person familiar with the matter, reported on Thursday that Israel was preparing for an attack by Iran as soon as Friday or Saturday.
Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from East Jerusalem, said the Israeli army announced that it was preparing on all fronts offensively and defensively.
“A couple of weeks ago, the Israelis increased their alertness level, calling up reservists and bolstering air defence systems,” she said, adding that Israeli officials said they were prepared for anything.
Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip since October 7 and sent in ground forces, killing at least 33,600 Palestinians and injuring more than 76,000. Hamas’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel killed more than 1,100 people there.
Israel has also stepped up strikes against Iranian personnel and allies in Syria and Lebanon and has traded near daily cross-border fire with the Lebanese group Hezbollah since the start of the war.

Here is what happened and what analysts say could happen next:
What happened in Israel and when?

Iran’s massive aerial attack marks the first direct strike by Iran on Israeli territory from Iranian soil. Iran called the attack Operation True Promise.
The attack began on Saturday about 20:00 GMT. It lasted about five hours, according to United States officials.
During the attack, explosions were heard in cities across Israel, including Tel Aviv. The explosions were also heard in Jerusalem, and air raid sirens sounded in more than 720 locations as Israeli forces sought to shoot down the projectiles.
Israel’s chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said Iran’s attack involved more than 120 ballistic missiles, 170 drones and more than 30 cruise missiles, according to a report by The Associated Press news agency.
The Israeli military also said the vast majority of the projectiles were intercepted outside the country’s borders with help from the US, the United Kingdom and France. Jordan also shot down some of the missiles aimed at Israel as they were flying through Jordanian airspace.
Israel’s military added that a “small number of hits were identified”. In a base in southern Israel, “minor damage occurred to the infrastructure”, it said.
A seven-year-old girl was also severely injured by missile fragments while other patients sustained minor injuries and some were treated for anxiety.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday that the US also intercepted “dozens” of missiles and drones launched at Israel from Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

 



 
Where exactly did the attacks take place?

During the attack, Israel’s military ordered residents in the northern Israeli-occupied Golan Heights – near the Syrian and Lebanese borders – and in the southern cities of Nevatim, Dimona and Eilat to remain near bomb shelters.
Nevatim is the site of an Israeli airbase while Dimona has a nuclear reactor on its outskirts. Eilat is Israel’s Red Sea port, which has suffered a sharp decline in operations because of repeated attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on ships using the waterway.


Why did Iran attack Israel?

Iran carried out the attacks in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed an Iranian military commander, Major General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, in Damascus on April 1. He was killed along with six other Iranian nationals, including another general. At least six Syrian citizens were also killed.
“It seems that Iranian leaders are determined to take action but also [be] seen to take action,” David Des Roches, an associate professor at the National Defense University in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.
“What that indicates to me is that there are considerations of pride and prestige that are divorced from strategy and tactical utility that may indicate a more dangerous era than we thought,” he added.
Hezbollah, a Lebanese armed group backed by Iran, and the Israeli military have been trading attacks across the Lebanon-Israel border since October 8, the day after the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel and Israel’s brutal retaliation on the besieged Gaza Strip.
On Saturday, Iranian state media announced that the armed forces had seized an Israel-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz.

(Al Jazeera)
What is the Israeli government saying?


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will win” in a tweet after the attacks. Earlier, he spoke to the nation, stating that the military was prepared for any scenario.  



“Citizens of Israel, in recent years and especially in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran,” Netanyahu said.
“Our defensive systems are deployed. We are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively. The State of Israel is strong. The [Israeli army] is strong. The public is strong.” He also thanked his allies, including the US and UK, for “standing alongside” Israel.
Towards the end of Sunday, the Israeli war cabinet – comprising Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Minister Benny Gantz and several observers – met to discuss a response to the attacks but were divided on how and when to respond, according to media reports.
A senior official from US President Joe Biden’s administration said Israel was not seeking to escalate the situation.
“I think Israel made clear to us they’re not looking for a significant escalation with Iran. That’s not what they’re looking for. They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.

 



 
What is the Iranian government saying?

Iran warned Israel against any response. The chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, told state TV that if Israel retaliates, Iran’s response would be “much larger” than the overnight bombardment, according to a report by the Reuters news agency.

Iran also warned Washington that backing Israeli retaliation would lead to the targeting of US bases.


Earlier, Iran’s mission to the United Nations cited the UN Charter’s provision for self-defence under Article 51 and said the country considered “the matter … concluded”.

“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” it said on X. “It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the US MUST STAY AWAY!”
President Ebrahim Raisi issued a statement hailing the “brave men” of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who “taught a lesson to the Zionist regime”.


Conducted on the strength of Article 51 of the UN Charter pertaining to legitimate defense, Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli…

What could come next for Iran, Israel and the region?

Gideon Levy, an Israeli journalist and author, spoke to Al Jazeera about what could come next and said that if Israel were to strike back, “we are facing a regional war.”  It is a scenario he does not think will happen, especially, he said, “after the very clear and impressive aid of the United States to Israel”.
“The extent of the Biden administration’s support means Israel will have to follow the US government’s advice not to retaliate after last night’s attack,” Levy said.
“Netanyahu cannot attack Iran without the backing of the US and be exposed to a worse attack than last night,” he added.
Separately, analyst and journalist Daoub Kuttab wrote that the exchange between Israel and Iran “has left the rest of the Arab world terrified of what another regional war could do to an already devastated region”.
“And if it is to take place, there will be not just regional, but global repercussions,” he added.
“Any regional Iranian-Israeli conflict will pull in the Gulf countries but also the US, Russia and China, creating a potentially explosive global confrontation.”

 



 
What are the international reactions so far?

The aerial assault has drawn condemnation from Israel’s allies and warnings that it risked further escalation in the Middle East.
Biden made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, according to a senior administration official. But he reiterated his support for Israel.
“Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the White House quoted Biden as saying.
The UN Security Council held a meeting and called on Iran and Israel to show restraint. “Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the meeting. “Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate.”
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned of the risk of a spillover conflict in the Middle East, stating that any escalation in the region would lead to “dangerous paths”.

Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed concern over the “military escalation” and called for restraint from all parties.

China also said it was deeply concerned about escalation, adding that it was a “spillover of the Gaza conflict” and a ceasefire should be implemented without delay.
India also expressed concern and called for an “immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of democracy”.
After a meeting on Sunday, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) said: “We … unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms Iran’s direct and unprecedented attack against Israel.”
The G7 said these actions “risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. … This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilise the situation and avoid further escalation.”

Lebanon said its airport will resume its activities after the overnight closure, state TV reported.
Iraq’s aviation authority said security risks had now been overcome.
Meanwhile, Israel also reopened its airspace as of 7:30am (04:30 GMT) on Sunday, adding that flight schedules from Tel Aviv were expected to be affected.
Flag carrier El Al said it had resumed operations and was “working to stabilise the flight schedule as soon as possible”. “El Al will continue to operate as much as possible to preserve the air bridge to and from Israel,” it said.
 



 
Late on Saturday night, Iran launched explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel – its first direct attack on Israeli territory in a retaliatory strike that raises the threat of wider regional conflict.
Tehran had pledged to retaliate for what it says was an Israeli attack on Iran’s embassy compound last week in Damascus that killed a senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’s overseas Quds Force and six other officers.
Jordan, which lies between Iran and Israel, had readied air defences to intercept any drones or missiles that violated its territory, two regional security sources told the Reuters news agency.
Jordan said it intercepted some flying objects that entered its airspace last night to ensure the safety of citizens, a cabinet statement said.
“Some shrapnel fell in multiple places during that time without causing any significant damage or any injuries to citizens,” it added.
Reaction to Iran’s strikes has been swift, with many countries describing the attacks as a serious escalation, with potentially widespread consequences for the region.
The attacks come amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza, which shows no sign of easing despite numerous mediation efforts.
 



 
Meanwhile, global airlines have also been cancelling flights and changing routes after Iran’s attacks.
The United Arab Emirates-based Emirates announced the cancellation of some of its flights and the re-routing of others, the airline’s spokesperson said.
“We are closely monitoring the situation and making all efforts to ensure minimal disruption to customers after recent airspace closures,” a spokesperson from the airline said.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways cancelled flights to Jordan and Israel on Sunday, the airline said in a statement.
Swiss International Air Lines has suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv until further notice, the airline said in a post on social media platform X on Sunday.
Swiss, which is owned by German carrier Lufthansa, said all of its planes were avoiding the airspaces of Iran, Iraq and Israel, causing delays to flights from India and Singapore.
Lufthansa said it was suspending flights to Amman, Beirut, Erbil and Tel Aviv at least until Monday following the latest turmoil in the Middle East.
In a statement to Reuters news agency, the German carrier said it would also ensure its flights avoided the airspace above Israel, Jordan and Iraq for the foreseeable future.
Austrian Airlines, which is also part of the Lufthansa Group, announced it was suspending flights to Tehran until April 18.
“Long-haul routes through the Middle East will also be rerouted accordingly due to various airspace closures,” the airline said in a statement.
As a precaution, Iran’s Imam Khomeini international airport and the Mehrabad airport, which is mainly dedicated to domestic flights, will remain closed until Monday at 06:00 am (0230 GMT), according to ISNA news agency.

The ship was commandeered by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the elite force that lost seven members, including two generals, in the Syria strike, Iranian state media reported on Saturday.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Tensions rise amid expectations of Iran retaliation against Israellist 2 of 4Iran’s Khamenei promises ‘Israel will be punished’ for Syria strikelist 3 of 4Who was Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an Iranian general killed by Israel in Syria?list 4 of 4WHO worker and Iranian adviser among several killed in Syria air strikesend of list
“The ship has now been guided towards the territorial waters of our country,” state-run IRNA reported.
The vessel was identified as the Portugal-flagged MSC Aries, which reportedly departed from a port in the United Arab Emirates en route to India. It is associated with the London-based Zodiac Maritime, a part of the Zodiac Group run by Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer and his family.
(Al Jazeera)
Footage from the deck of the vessel obtained by The Associated Press news agency on Saturday showed soldiers rappelling down from a helicopter.
‌The helicopter appeared to be a Soviet-designed Mil Mi-17, which is operated by the naval forces of the IRGC.
Zodiac Maritime said in a statement that MSC, an Italian-Swiss shipping group, was responsible for all vessel activities.
MSC confirmed there were 25 crew members on board the ship, adding in a statement that it is “working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure their wellbeing, and safe return of the vessel”.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) had said a vessel was seized by “regional authorities” 50 nautical miles (92km) northeast of the UAE’s Fujairah in a waterway vital to world trade.
Another Israeli-linked container ship was attacked and damaged by a drone in the Indian Ocean in late November, which the United States blamed on Iran.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a post on X that the move by Iran was “a pirate operation in violation of international law”.
He called on the European Union and “the free world to immediately declare” the IRGC a “terrorist organization and to sanction Iran now”.
White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the ship’s crew comprised of Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, Russian and Estonian nationals, and pushed back against the vessel’s seizure.
“We call on Iran to release the vessel and its international crew immediately,” she said. “Seizing a civilian vessel without provocation is a blatant violation of international law, and an act of piracy by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.”
 



 
Soaring regional tensions
The US military is moving more military assets to the Middle East as it anticipates an Iranian response to the Israeli attack on the consulate in Syria.
A US defence official told Al Jazeera that the move is mainly aimed at better protecting US troops in the region, but also to ramp up regional deterrence.
US media confirmed the move but the Pentagon has not officially said which assets it is moving to the region.
The Wall Street Journal quoted unnamed US officials as saying on Friday that it includes repositioning two destroyers, with one of the warships already in the region and another redirected there.
On Saturday, US President Joe Biden said he was cutting short his weekend stay in Delaware to return to the White House early to meet with his national security team and monitor the security situation ahead of a feared Iranian attack on Israel.
On Friday, Biden said he expected an Iranian retaliation to come “sooner than later” and that Washington will continue to defend Israel.
“Don’t,” he said when asked by reporters if he had a message for Iran.
Since the start of the war on Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in Israel, the US has sent thousands of bombs and ammunition to its ally Israel despite growing international criticism, along with moving warships and troops to the region.
John Kirby, the White House’s national security spokesman, said on Friday that Iran’s threats to retaliate against Israel remain “real” and viable”.
General Erik Kurilla, the head of US Central Command in the region, arrived in Israel on Friday to discuss a potential Iranian attack and met with top officials, including Israeli military chief of staff Herzi Halevi.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that “Iran funds, trains, and arms terror proxies across the Middle East and beyond”, adding that the Islamic republic doesn’t just threaten the people of Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria”, but “fuels the war in Ukraine and beyond”.
He said that Israel was on “high alert” and was “prepared to respond” to what he called “any Iranian aggression”.

“If the Zionist regime [Israel] or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response,” Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement on Sunday.
Raisi’s statement follows a similar warning by Iranian military chief, Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, who told state TV that a “much larger” response awaits Israel “if it retaliates against Iran”.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Iran launches hundreds of missiles, drones in first direct attack on Israellist 2 of 4Biden vows G7 response, ‘ironclad’ US support for Israel after Iran attackslist 3 of 4Hamas backs Iran after retaliatory missile, drone attacks on Israellist 4 of 4‘Serious escalation’: World reacts to Iran’s drone, missile raids on Israelend of list Advertisement 
Bagheri said the Iranian attack on Israel “has achieved all its goals, and in our view the operation has ended, and we do not intend to continue”.
Earlier on Sunday, he warned the US that any backing of Israeli retaliation would result in its bases being targeted by Iran.
However, in a signal that Iran’s response was calculated in an attempt to avoid any major escalation, the Iranian foreign minister Amir Abdollahian said that Tehran had informed the US of the planned attack 72 hours in advance, and said that the strikes would be “limited” and for self-defence. Advertisement 


That did not stop more aggressive language from other officials, with the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, warning that Tehran would retaliate against any Israeli attacks on its interests, officials or citizens.
“From now on, whenever Israel attacks Iranian interests… we will attack from Iran.”
Meanwhile, Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations justified Tehran’s response to Israeli “aggression” as a “legitimate defence” in accordance with the UN charter.
“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” said a statement.
It added that the US should “stay away” from the conflict, as it is an issue between Iran and Israel.


Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the Iranian attacks would be seen by its nationals as a “historic event in the country”. Advertisement 
“For over 40 years, Iran has been talking about going to war with Israel as one of its main adversaries,” she said, adding that celebrations were held in several Iranian cities over the air raids.
‘Significant response’
Tehran’s attacks late on Saturday were launched after a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 1 killed IRGC members, raising the threat of a wider regional conflict.
On Sunday, Israel reported modest damage and reopened its airspace following the unprecedented direct attack. Advertisement 
The Israeli military said the armed forces had shot down more than 99 percent of the Iranian drones and missiles and were discussing follow-up options.


In a brief statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, “We intercepted. We blocked. Together we will win.”
Meanwhile, Israel’s defence chief, Yoav Gallant, warned in a televised statement that the confrontation with Iran “is not over yet”.
Israel’s Channel 12 TV quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a “significant response” to the attack.
Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, also called Iran’s actions “very grave”, saying in a televised briefing that they “push the region toward escalation”.
Despite the rhetoric, one Iranian analyst said the statements coming from Iran offer an opening for the opposing parties to back off from a wider confrontation.
Farzan Sabet, a senior researcher at the Geneva-based Global Governance Centre, said Israel “has a potential off-ramp” by making a “largely symbolic and non- or only slightly lethal response”.
But given Israel’s “historically low threat tolerance and practice of disproportionate response”, further retaliations and escalations could be seen, he said in an analysis posted on X.

The days ahead will show if those two options are compatible, or if the two governments’ priorities are on a collision course, analysts told Al Jazeera.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Iran attacks Israel with over 300 drones, missiles: What you need to knowlist 2 of 3Amid the Israel-Iran escalation, it’s time for a region-wide ceasefirelist 3 of 3Sorry, but Iran is not the aggressor hereend of list
In the short term, the April 13-14 Iranian attack is a coup for both Israel and its backers in the United States. From their perspective, it offers renewed justification for military support to Israel while weakening the world’s focus on alleged abuses committed in Gaza in seven months of war, according to Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Washington-based Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
But defiance from Netanyahu to US calls for restraint could find the Biden administration further hamstrung by its political and ideological commitments to Israel, which could eventually drag Washington into a wider war, he added.
“The Israelis have been told by Biden to take this as a win and stop here,” Parsi told Al Jazeera. “While that is helpful, it is by no stretch of the imagination strong and clear enough given Netanyahu’s systematic defiance of Biden’s advice and warnings in private over the course of the last seven months.”
“This is a moment – given the fact we’re looking into the abyss in terms of the region – that Biden has to be much clearer and much stronger in drawing a red line for Israel and Netanyahu not to bring the entire region into a war.”
Operation ‘True Promise ‘
Biden cut short a weekend trip and returned to Washington, DC, as Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel on Saturday in what Tehran dubbed operation “True Promise”.
The assault represented the first time Iran had ever directly attacked Israel, and Iranian officials said it was meant to establish “deterrence”. It came as a direct response to an April 1 Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, that killed eight people, including two Iranian generals, and was widely condemned for violating diplomatic norms. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the embassies of countries are considered on par with their sovereign territory: Legally, the bombing of the Iranian diplomatic mission in Syria was equivalent to an attack on Iranian soil.
But several analysts suggested Tehran’s attacks were potentially meant as a signal to Washington. The US and Israel said that nearly all of the more than 300 launches were intercepted, with only minor damage reported. In that way, the attack allowed Tehran to conduct what many considered to be an inevitable response to Israel’s strike on its consulate, while removing some of the variables that could come from a more surprise attack or by proxy forces, and that in turn could potentially trigger a less controllable conflict, according to Khalil Jahshan, the executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC.
 



 
 
“I’m not conspiracy prone, but I have a feeling there has been some coordination between the parties with regard to this over the past few days,” Jahshan told Al Jazeera, noting that this reportedly came via third parties in the region.
“A lot of information has been shared between Tehran and Washington. So [the attack] was not a surprise … It’s kind of political theatre by other means.”
On Sunday, Reuters news agency, citing a Biden administration official, reported that the US had contact with Iran through Swiss intermediaries both before and after the attack. However, the official denied that Iran had given “notification” ahead of the launches, which the official maintained sought to “destroy and to cause casualties”.
‘Arsonist and firefighter’
In the wake of the attack, Iran’s mission to the UN signalled there were no further plans to retaliate against Israel, saying in a statement “the matter can be deemed concluded”.
“However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” it said, warning the US to “stay away”.
For its part, top US and Israeli officials spent the hours after the attack on a flurry of calls, with Biden reportedly telling Netanyahu that Washington would not support a subsequent Israeli strike on Iran. Biden stressed the strength Israel had projected in defending against the attack, administration officials said, while seeking to defuse further fighting.
In that, the Biden administration’s response has embodied a “microcosm of their overall approach since the seventh of October”, according to Brian Finucane, a senior adviser for the US programme at Crisis Group.
That approach “is to play both the roles of arsonist and firefighter in Israel-Palestine and in the wider Middle East”, he said.
 



 
The Biden administration has continued to provide material and political support for Israel amid the war in Gaza, even as it has faced growing domestic pressure to condition aid amid widespread allegations of Israeli violations in the enclave. At least 33,729 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to Gaza authorities.
The administration has been criticised for exerting mostly rhetorical pressure on Netanyahu’s government in recent weeks, while declining to use material leverage. However, an April 1 Israeli strike in Gaza that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers – including citizens of the US and its allies – saw the Biden administration take its harshest stance yet against Israel.
Still, Finucane explained that US weapons have enabled Israeli strikes throughout the region “arguably in violation of US law” for years.
“Israel’s strikes in Syria, including the strike in Damascus on April 1 which precipitated this particular crisis, have been conducted with US-supplied warplanes,” he said, noting that the use may violate the Arms Export Control Act, which says US weapons should only be used in legitimate self-defence.
Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, pointed to opposition from the US, United Kingdom and France to a United Nations Security Council statement in early April that would have condemned the Israeli strike on Iran’s consulate, which he described as an “escalatory breach of normal diplomatic rules”.
“The US has claimed that it’s time to stop this escalation,” Landis told Al Jazeera. “But in fact, it’s been pouring fuel on the fire by taking Israel’s side so one-sidedly and breaching international norms.”
Will Netanyahu listen?
The current situation leaves the next move squarely in Israel’s hands, several analysts told Al Jazeera.
Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have not yet signalled whether they will respond and how, although some members of the government have called for a firm response.
“I think it’s very clear that Washington and Tehran ironically are closer in their objective. Both do not want escalation for their own reasons,” Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera.
“Netanyahu is the wild card here. And the danger for the US is that should [Israel] not heed their calls for calm, they might find themselves dragged in and forced to come to Israel’s aid, perhaps begrudgingly,” he said.
In both the US and Israel, domestic politics will likely guide what comes next, according to Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King’s College London.
“Netanyahu urgently needs a victory narrative; he urgently needs to project some sort of strength to his own constituents,” Krieg told Al Jazeera.
 



 
“So that makes him the most prone candidate to escalate further,” he said. “He certainly has always been quite risk-prone when it comes to his political survival … So it’s not really about Israel’s security interests – it’s about his own political survival.”
The Israeli PM has been the target of regular — and large — protests within Israel, with many calling for his resignation. Several analysts have suggested that Netanyahu’s best bet to stay in power is to keep the war going.
Meanwhile, Iran’s attack has already reinvigorated efforts to provide more military aid to Israel, after weeks of mounting pressure on the Biden administration to place conditions on assistance to its Middle Eastern ally. On Sunday, US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said he would bring a vote on more aid to Israel in the chamber later this week.
“[The attack] has shifted the narrative. We’re discussing Israel being under an unprecedented attack from Iran today, we’re not talking about starving children in Gaza,” said Crisis Group’s Finucane. “We’re not talking about drone strikes on aid workers in Gaza, which was the subject of discussion a week ago.”
And while political pressure will continue for Biden to push for an end to the war, Netanyahu is also aware that Biden likely sees the political costs of breaking with Israel as even greater in an election year, the University of Oklahoma’s Landis added.
“Ultimately, that’s the bad news that comes out of this: That Israel has set itself up for a very long war in Gaza,” he said.
 



 
Because of long-standing US policy, the Arab Center’s Jahshan said he could not envision a scenario where Biden breaks from Netanyahu, regardless of what course of action the Israeli leader takes, and what its regional implications may be.
“Based on my personal knowledge of [Biden]  – having observed and dealt with him over decades – I think he is not capable of taking a disagreement with Israel to its ultimate conclusion,” he said.
“Maybe more verbosity and doublespeak, but a serious policy change? I do not foresee that.”

It was the single largest drone attack ever carried out by any country, and it was the first time Iran directly attacked Israel after almost a half-century of being archenemies.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Iran warns Israel, US of ‘severe response’ in case of retaliationlist 2 of 4Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq reopen airspace closed over Iran’s attacks on Israellist 3 of 4Iran’s IRGC seizes ‘Israeli-linked’ ship near Strait of Hormuzlist 4 of 4Iran’s Khamenei blasts Israel, West for ‘bloody’ Gaza war in Eid speechend of list
Here’s a look at what political, military and economic considerations Tehran might have factored in while deciding on the attack that has amplified fears of a larger regional war and that could also affect the direction of Israel’s war on Gaza.
The politics
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) dubbed the operation “True Promise” to show that top leaders in Tehran, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intend to make good on their vows of “punishment” for attacks by Israel and others.
The attack was in response to the April 1 Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed seven IRGC members, including two generals in charge of leading operations in Syria and Lebanon, along with six other people.
It was mainly aimed at strengthening Iran’s deterrence, which critics said had been compromised after increasingly confrontational policies and military strikes by the United States and its allies across the region, especially following the January 2020 assassination of top general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.
Iranian officials also appeared to have exercised a degree of “strategic patience” after the late December assassination of another top IRGC commander in Syria, Razi Mousavi, in an Israeli air raid amid the fallout of the war on Gaza.
Inaction, lower-grade strikes, or being content with military action through the “axis of resistance” of aligned groups across the region would in this vein be viewed as too costly for Iran both locally and abroad.
That is true even as Tehran recognises that Israel and the embattled government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may see benefits in escalating tensions across the region and forcing the US military into taking more action against Iran.
On the other hand, the unprecedented Iranian attacks may have briefly shifted the world’s attention from the deaths of tens of thousands of women and children in the Gaza Strip, but they could translate into soft power gains for Iran in the Muslim world in the long run, when compared with other regional powers.
Saudi Arabia has not ruled out normalising relations with Israel despite the carnage in Gaza, and Turkey only started limiting some exports to Israel earlier this week after the Israeli government refused to allow it to airdrop aid over the besieged enclave, where infants are dying of starvation. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey have, however, been deeply — and vocally — critical of Israel’s war on Gaza.
Iran would also have plausible arguments at the United Nations Security Council since attacks on diplomatic missions signal a violation of the Vienna Convention, and since Article 51 of the UN Charter enshrines the “inherent right” of self-defence, something Israel has been heavily leaning on since the start of the Gaza war.
 



 
A list of military firsts for Iran
There is no official confirmation from Iran about exactly how many drones or ballistic and cruise missiles it used to attack Israel, but the Israeli military said more than 300 were launched.
Iranian drones have been making international headlines for the past few years, especially following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ukrainian officials say the Iranian-designed Shahed drones of the Russian military continue to rain down over their territory.
Shahed-136 kamikaze drones that carry a relatively small warhead weighing some 50kg (110 pounds) were used in the attack on Israel, Iranian state television said on Sunday.
Telegram channels affiliated with the IRGC said the Shahed-238, which is powered by a turbojet rather than the propeller on the 136 model, was also used in the attack. The 238 model sacrifices some manoeuvrability for significantly higher speeds that are believed to reach as high as 600kmph (372mph).
Iran has long been known to possess the largest and most varied missile arsenal in the Middle East, but this was by far the largest test of its capabilities.

State television said the Emad long-range ballistic missile and the Paveh cruise missile were used to attack Israel.
In February, in large-scale military exercises that included simulating an attack on the Palmachim airbase in Israel, the IRGC used Emad missiles and launched the Dezful ballistic missile from a warship.
Iran also possesses Fattah, a hypersonic ballistic missile that could theoretically arrive in Israel in as little as seven minutes, along with a cruise missile variant of the same family. There was no indication the missiles were used in the early Sunday attacks.
Either way, in multilayered attacks over several hours, Iran has just managed to conduct its largest-ever drone and missile strikes that covered some of their longest distances in a real military operation.
“The operation achieved a level of success that exceeded our expectations,” said IRGC commander-in-chief Hossein Salami, adding that the projectiles only targeted military sites, including the Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert that was allegedly used to launch the Israeli strikes on the Iranian consulate in Syria.
What are the economic effects?
The effect of the historic attacks on the already-troubled Iranian economy was likely lower than the weight of political and military dimensions on the list of considerations for Iranian leaders as they planned the offensive in almost two weeks since the consulate attack.
But as expected, there was an immediate reaction in local markets, with foreign currencies climbing amid rising anxieties over prospects of the conflict further sliding into a regional war.
The rial, Iran’s falling national currency, dropped to a new all-time low of about 670,000 per US dollar on Sunday before regaining some ground.
The semiofficial Tasnim news website reported on Sunday that very few currency and gold deals are taking place in Tehran and other markets as an atmosphere of caution is dominant.
The Tehran prosecutor’s office announced on Sunday that it opened a case against an unnamed journalist and the Jahan-e Sanat newspaper they worked for due to “disturbing the society’s psychological security and disturbing the economic atmosphere of the country”.

The overnight escalation came more than six months into Israel’s devastating war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians and pushed the besieged territory to the brink of famine. The war has driven up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.

The Israeli military said on Sunday the Iranian salvo consisted of more than 300 “killer drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles”, but that 99 percent were intercepted with help from forces from France, the United Kingdom and the United States.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3‘Serious escalation’: World reacts to Iran’s drone, missile raids on Israellist 2 of 3Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq reopen airspace closed over Iran’s attacks on Israellist 3 of 3‘True Promise’: Why and how did Iran launch a historic attack on Israel?end of list
The launches, which the army said came from Iran, as well as from Iraq and Yemen, set off air raid sirens in cities across Israel, including Tel Aviv, with explosions heard as air defences intercepted the projectiles.
Medics said a girl in southern Israel was wounded by shrapnel from an intercepted drone, while the military said “a small number of hits were identified, including at [an Israeli military] base in southern Israel, where minor damage was caused to infrastructure”.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed the attack, saying it launched the drones and missiles under Operation True Promise as part of the punishment for “the Zionist entity’s crime of targeting the Iranian consulate in Syria” on April 1.
The raid in Damascus killed 13 people, including two senior generals in the IRGC’s elite Quds Force.

Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.
With the missiles and drone attack, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said it now deemed the matter “concluded” and warned Israel of a “considerably more severe” response should the “Israeli regime make another mistake”.
It also warned the US to stay out of the conflict.
Fears of a wider escalation
Before the Iranian attack, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon announced temporarily closing their airspace, while Syria also put on high alert its Russian-made Pantsir ground-to-air defence systems around Damascus and major bases, according to the Reuters news agency.
Earlier on Saturday, Iranian armed forces seized a container ship linked to Israel near the Strait of Hormuz.
Western countries condemned Iran’s missile and drone assault, including the US, the UK, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Mexico, the Netherlands and Norway. Egypt and Saudi Arabia called for restraint, while the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency session to discuss the matter at Israel’s request.
US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house to meet his national security team at the White House on Saturday afternoon. He also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Saturday, reaffirming Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to its ally’s security.
Biden said he told Netanyahu that “Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel”.
Netanyahu, in a brief post on X, said Israel will achieve victory.
“We intercepted, we repelled, together we shall win,” he added.
The Pentagon meanwhile reported that defence chief Lloyd Austin had spoken with his Israeli counterpart “to discuss urgent regional threats … and made clear that Israel could count on full US support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies”.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned Iran’s attack, saying he was “deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation”.
Russian Deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said on the Telegram social media app that in addition to a letter from Israel, the UNSC had received one from Iran asserting its attack was within the UN Charter framework governing the right to self-defence.
“The latter warns that if Israel responds, Iran will respond in a more powerful and decisive manner,” Polyanskiy said.
 



 
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on all parties to “exercise calm and restraint”, describing the situation as the “latest spillover of the Gaza conflict”. It said it was deeply concerned by the escalation and said Israel’s war on Gaza “must end now”.
Analysts described Iran’s attack on Israel as carefully calibrated to prevent further escalation.
“What the Iranians are trying to do is to come up with a measured, calculated attack in order to regain deterrence and not to be seen as weak in front of their own proxies,” said Hassan Barari, professor of international relations at the University of Qatar.
However, he expressed worry that the attack could worsen the situation in Gaza.
“I know some right-wing politicians in the government will see this as an opportunity because the world’s attention has shifted onto Iran-Israel and then they can do something probably horrendous in Gaza,” he said.

The vast majority of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s air defence system, with assistance from the ever-helpful United States military, and damage was minimal. Having completed its retaliation, Iran has now declared that the matter can “be deemed concluded” – although Israel is not usually one to let anyone else have the last word.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Several Israeli troops wounded in Lebanon blastlist 2 of 4Palestinians come under Israeli fire as they attempt return to north Gazalist 3 of 4Bombs and viruses: The shadowy history of Israel’s attacks on Iranian soillist 4 of 4Mapping Israel-Lebanon cross-border attacksend of list
In the meantime, the barrage of criticism of Tehran’s “aggression” has continued unabated in the West.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned “in the strongest terms the Iranian regime’s reckless attack against Israel”, which he insisted had once again shown that Iran was “intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard”. The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs lamented that “Iran’s long term aggressive behavior is preventing the Middle East region to live in peace and security”.
For his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whined about Iran’s “disregard for peace and stability in the region”, and regurgitated that old, tired slogan about “Israel’s right to defend itself”. Germany’s Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert took to social media to proclaim German solidarity “with all Israelis tonight whom Iran is terrorising with this unprecedented and ruthless attack”.
Lastly, US President Joe Biden, who was forced to cut his beach weekend short due to the developments, announced: “Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad.”
The Iranian attack, mind you, occurred a little over six months into Israel’s ongoing pulverisation of the Gaza Strip, which has killed nearly 34,000 Palestinians, including some 13,800 children. And yet given the thousands of missing persons presumed to be buried under the rubble, even these terrifying numbers are no doubt grave underestimates. 

More than 76,000 people have been wounded, as the Israeli military has busied itself flattening entire neighbourhoods and blowing up schools, hospitals, and other basic infrastructure, all the while condemning the territory’s inhabitants to famine and starvation.
Talk about “terrorising”.
Indeed, genocide is nothing if not “long term aggressive behaviour” – to borrow the Czech Foreign Ministry’s words. If the whole business weren’t so unprecedently heinous, it would be almost laughable to claim that Iran is the one “intent on sowing chaos” and disregarding “peace and stability in the region”.
But because Israel’s outsize role as a prized US partner in crime entitles it to a total subversion of logic, genocidaires become victims and unmitigated Israeli aggression becomes “self-defence”. And never mind the April 1 Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus; that was just preemptive retaliation, right?
In light of the unceasing slaughter in Gaza, though, the Western response to the intercepted Iranian missiles and drones is sickeningly cynical. Sunak’s pathetic claim that “no one wants to see more bloodshed” fails to account for the reality that, as long as it’s Palestinian blood, it’s all totally fine.
Unfortunately, the Iranian spectacle may provide the Biden administration with exactly what it needs to shift the focus away from Gaza – and specifically US complicity in genocide. After all, it would be a sad day for the arms industry if the US had to stop sending so many weapons to such an active client.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the US was responsible for a full 69 percent of arms imports by the Israeli military between 2019 and 2023, when the all-out genocide kicked off.
So much for “peace and stability”.
But one should never underestimate the imperial utility of the good old Iranian menace in justifying whatever US policy needs justifying. Recall Tehran’s inclusion on the original “axis of evil” shortlist, courtesy of former US President George W Bush, who in his 2002 State of the Union address denounced Iran for “aggressively” pursuing weapons of mass destruction and “export[ing] terror”.
Armed with said “axis”, the US proceeded to engage in nothing less than mass destruction and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond.
Fast-forward 22 years to the present era of destruction, and the Iranian bogeyman is as handy as ever. Following this weekend’s attack, perhaps everyone’s favourite refrain “But do you condemn Hamas?” can be updated to: “But do you condemn Iran?”
As for things genuinely worthy of condemnation, these continue to include, well, genocide in Gaza – not to mention the brazenly hypocritical Western insistence on Israel’s “right to self-defence”, which ultimately amounts to genocidal apologetics.
And as leaders continue to trip over themselves in affirmation of solidarity with Israel after this “unprecedented attack”, we’d all do well to remember that you reap what you sow – and that Iran is not the aggressor here.

Here is what happened and what analysts say could happen next:
What happened in Israel and when?

Iran’s massive aerial attack marks the first direct strike by Iran on Israeli territory from Iranian soil. Iran called the attack Operation True Promise.
The attack began on Saturday about 20:00 GMT. It lasted about five hours, according to United States officials.
During the attack, explosions were heard in cities across Israel, including Tel Aviv. The explosions were also heard in Jerusalem, and air raid sirens sounded in more than 720 locations as Israeli forces sought to shoot down the projectiles.
Israel’s chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said Iran’s attack involved more than 120 ballistic missiles, 170 drones and more than 30 cruise missiles, according to a report by The Associated Press news agency.
The Israeli military also said the vast majority of the projectiles were intercepted outside the country’s borders with help from the US, the United Kingdom and France. Jordan also shot down some of the missiles aimed at Israel as they were flying through Jordanian airspace.
Israel’s military added that a “small number of hits were identified”. In a base in southern Israel, “minor damage occurred to the infrastructure”, it said.
A seven-year-old girl was also severely injured by missile fragments while other patients sustained minor injuries and some were treated for anxiety.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday that the US also intercepted “dozens” of missiles and drones launched at Israel from Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

 



 
Where exactly did the attacks take place?

During the attack, Israel’s military ordered residents in the northern Israeli-occupied Golan Heights – near the Syrian and Lebanese borders – and in the southern cities of Nevatim, Dimona and Eilat to remain near bomb shelters.
Nevatim is the site of an Israeli airbase while Dimona has a nuclear reactor on its outskirts. Eilat is Israel’s Red Sea port, which has suffered a sharp decline in operations because of repeated attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on ships using the waterway.


Why did Iran attack Israel?

Iran carried out the attacks in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike that killed an Iranian military commander, Major General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, in Damascus on April 1. He was killed along with six other Iranian nationals, including another general. At least six Syrian citizens were also killed.
“It seems that Iranian leaders are determined to take action but also [be] seen to take action,” David Des Roches, an associate professor at the National Defense University in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.
“What that indicates to me is that there are considerations of pride and prestige that are divorced from strategy and tactical utility that may indicate a more dangerous era than we thought,” he added.
Hezbollah, a Lebanese armed group backed by Iran, and the Israeli military have been trading attacks across the Lebanon-Israel border since October 8, the day after the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel and Israel’s brutal retaliation on the besieged Gaza Strip.
On Saturday, Iranian state media announced that the armed forces had seized an Israel-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz.

(Al Jazeera)
What is the Israeli government saying?


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will win” in a tweet after the attacks. Earlier, he spoke to the nation, stating that the military was prepared for any scenario.  



“Citizens of Israel, in recent years and especially in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran,” Netanyahu said.
“Our defensive systems are deployed. We are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively. The State of Israel is strong. The [Israeli army] is strong. The public is strong.” He also thanked his allies, including the US and UK, for “standing alongside” Israel.
Towards the end of Sunday, the Israeli war cabinet – comprising Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Minister Benny Gantz and several observers – met to discuss a response to the attacks but were divided on how and when to respond, according to media reports.
A senior official from US President Joe Biden’s administration said Israel was not seeking to escalate the situation.
“I think Israel made clear to us they’re not looking for a significant escalation with Iran. That’s not what they’re looking for. They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.

 



 
What is the Iranian government saying?

Iran warned Israel against any response. The chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, told state TV that if Israel retaliates, Iran’s response would be “much larger” than the overnight bombardment, according to a report by the Reuters news agency.

Iran also warned Washington that backing Israeli retaliation would lead to the targeting of US bases.


Earlier, Iran’s mission to the United Nations cited the UN Charter’s provision for self-defence under Article 51 and said the country considered “the matter … concluded”.

“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” it said on X. “It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the US MUST STAY AWAY!”
President Ebrahim Raisi issued a statement hailing the “brave men” of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who “taught a lesson to the Zionist regime”.


Conducted on the strength of Article 51 of the UN Charter pertaining to legitimate defense, Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli…
— Permanent Mission of I.R.Iran to UN, NY (@Iran_UN) April 13, 2024

What could come next for Iran, Israel and the region?

Gideon Levy, an Israeli journalist and author, spoke to Al Jazeera about what could come next and said that if Israel were to strike back, “we are facing a regional war.”  It is a scenario he does not think will happen, especially, he said, “after the very clear and impressive aid of the United States to Israel”.
“The extent of the Biden administration’s support means Israel will have to follow the US government’s advice not to retaliate after last night’s attack,” Levy said.
“Netanyahu cannot attack Iran without the backing of the US and be exposed to a worse attack than last night,” he added.
Separately, analyst and journalist Daoub Kuttab wrote that the exchange between Israel and Iran “has left the rest of the Arab world terrified of what another regional war could do to an already devastated region”.
“And if it is to take place, there will be not just regional, but global repercussions,” he added.
“Any regional Iranian-Israeli conflict will pull in the Gulf countries but also the US, Russia and China, creating a potentially explosive global confrontation.”

 



 
What are the international reactions so far?

The aerial assault has drawn condemnation from Israel’s allies and warnings that it risked further escalation in the Middle East.
Biden made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, according to a senior administration official. But he reiterated his support for Israel.
“Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the White House quoted Biden as saying.
The UN Security Council held a meeting and called on Iran and Israel to show restraint. “Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the meeting. “Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate.”
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned of the risk of a spillover conflict in the Middle East, stating that any escalation in the region would lead to “dangerous paths”.

Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed concern over the “military escalation” and called for restraint from all parties.

China also said it was deeply concerned about escalation, adding that it was a “spillover of the Gaza conflict” and a ceasefire should be implemented without delay.
India also expressed concern and called for an “immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of democracy”.
After a meeting on Sunday, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) said: “We … unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms Iran’s direct and unprecedented attack against Israel.”
The G7 said these actions “risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. … This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilise the situation and avoid further escalation.”

Lebanon said its airport will resume its activities after the overnight closure, state TV reported.
Iraq’s aviation authority said security risks had now been overcome.
Meanwhile, Israel also reopened its airspace as of 7:30am (04:30 GMT) on Sunday, adding that flight schedules from Tel Aviv were expected to be affected.
Flag carrier El Al said it had resumed operations and was “working to stabilise the flight schedule as soon as possible”. “El Al will continue to operate as much as possible to preserve the air bridge to and from Israel,” it said.
 



 
Late on Saturday night, Iran launched explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel – its first direct attack on Israeli territory in a retaliatory strike that raises the threat of wider regional conflict.
Tehran had pledged to retaliate for what it says was an Israeli attack on Iran’s embassy compound last week in Damascus that killed a senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’s overseas Quds Force and six other officers.
Jordan, which lies between Iran and Israel, had readied air defences to intercept any drones or missiles that violated its territory, two regional security sources told the Reuters news agency.
Jordan said it intercepted some flying objects that entered its airspace last night to ensure the safety of citizens, a cabinet statement said.
“Some shrapnel fell in multiple places during that time without causing any significant damage or any injuries to citizens,” it added.
Reaction to Iran’s strikes has been swift, with many countries describing the attacks as a serious escalation, with potentially widespread consequences for the region.
The attacks come amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza, which shows no sign of easing despite numerous mediation efforts.
 



 
Meanwhile, global airlines have also been cancelling flights and changing routes after Iran’s attacks.
The United Arab Emirates-based Emirates announced the cancellation of some of its flights and the re-routing of others, the airline’s spokesperson said.
“We are closely monitoring the situation and making all efforts to ensure minimal disruption to customers after recent airspace closures,” a spokesperson from the airline said.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways cancelled flights to Jordan and Israel on Sunday, the airline said in a statement.
Swiss International Air Lines has suspended flights to and from Tel Aviv until further notice, the airline said in a post on social media platform X on Sunday.
Swiss, which is owned by German carrier Lufthansa, said all of its planes were avoiding the airspaces of Iran, Iraq and Israel, causing delays to flights from India and Singapore.
Lufthansa said it was suspending flights to Amman, Beirut, Erbil and Tel Aviv at least until Monday following the latest turmoil in the Middle East.
In a statement to Reuters news agency, the German carrier said it would also ensure its flights avoided the airspace above Israel, Jordan and Iraq for the foreseeable future.
Austrian Airlines, which is also part of the Lufthansa Group, announced it was suspending flights to Tehran until April 18.
“Long-haul routes through the Middle East will also be rerouted accordingly due to various airspace closures,” the airline said in a statement.
As a precaution, Iran’s Imam Khomeini international airport and the Mehrabad airport, which is mainly dedicated to domestic flights, will remain closed until Monday at 06:00 am (0230 GMT), according to ISNA news agency.

According to the Israeli army, 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted by its jets and those of its allies, including the United States and Jordan. Others were stopped by Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system, acquired and operated with US help.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3‘True Promise’: Why and how did Iran launch a historic attack on Israel?list 2 of 3Iran warns Israel, US of ‘severe response’ in case of retaliationlist 3 of 3Iran attacks Israel with over 300 drones, missiles: What you need to knowend of list
While Western diplomats and US President Joe Biden have reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu they will not support further retaliation, some analysts suggest that last night’s strikes may be part of a wider ploy to draw the US, Israel’s close ally, into a broader regional war.
Laying the foundation on April 1?
In determining how Israel may respond to the overnight attack, analysts have focused on Israel’s own attack on the Iranian consulate on April 1.
That strike, which killed two Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) generals and five officers, was carried out with scant regard to Israel’s allies, who were only notified shortly ahead of the attack, according to at least one analyst Al Jazeera spoke to.
Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at SWP Berlin, outlined two scenarios, both resting upon the motivations behind the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate.
 



 
In the first scenario, the Israeli strike occurred with little or no thought given to the consequences. In the second, the strike was a deliberate attempt to draw Iran into regional war and shift US and Western focus away from Israel’s war on Gaza and towards the regional bogeyman, Iran.
In both scenarios, US involvement would be critical.
Despite its status as a regional superpower, Israel – overstretched by six months of war on Gaza – would stand little chance against Iran’s standing army of at least 580,000, supplemented by some 200,000 trained reserve personnel, divided among the army and the IRGC.
“Netanyahu’s plan is clear, to distract attention from the war in Gaza and to drag the US and other Western allies back into the Middle East,”  Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an associate fellow at Chatham House, said.
“Given the close relationship between Israel and the US and Israel’s dependency on US aid, Israel should have informed the US that it was planning to attack the Iranian consulate building where the IRGC is based.
“By not doing so, Israel crossed a red line. Israel’s motives … need to be questioned. An attack on a foreign consulate constitutes a strike on foreign soil under international law, and it is clear that Netanyahu knew he was crossing the line and that Iran would respond with force,” she said.

For years, Iran has maintained steady pressure on Israel through its proxies, not least Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has maintained an exchange of fire with Israel dating back from before October 7.
Eyes on the prize
Netanyahu’s motivations for attempting to claw the US into the war likely run deeper than Israel’s interests alone, analysts say, and likely speak to concerns closer to his heart.
Polls in Israel show the prime minister’s popularity to be at a critical low. After Netanyahu built his reputation upon claims that only he and his Likud Party stood between Israelis and oblivion, the surprise attack by Hamas-led fighters on October 7 has severely damaged his standing.
“Israel’s options are most impacted by how Netanyahu, who is embattled domestically and internationally, will choose to take advantage of Western sympathy for Tel Aviv following Iran’s highly telegraphed attack,” said HA Hellyer, an authority on Middle East security at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute.
In the months leading up to October, popular discontent with Netanyahu was growing after his extreme right-wing government attempted to force through changes that would hobble Israel’s independent judiciary.
In the months since October 7, protests have been growing against his handling of the war on Gaza as he is perceived to be less than interested in securing the release of the remaining captives taken from Israel in the attack.
The protests, in addition to swelling, have developed into demonstrations against him and his rule.

 
Even the US seemed to have lost patience with Netanyahu, with a highly publicised invitation issued to Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, to visit Washington, DC for talks.
Netanyahu has worked to regain lost ground, using every opportunity to position himself at the forefront of a surge of nationalism that makes many people in Israel reluctant to call for an end to the war.
‘A tipping point’
However, irrespective of how Israel chooses to portray itself in this latest clash, it is the US staging the play.
“What we have heard so far is that the US has no interest in a war and are signalling that there will be a unified diplomatic response to Iran from the West, while at the same time calling for restraint,” Azizi said.
With the US’s signalling, Netanyahu’s gambit looks in jeopardy.
“We are at a tipping point and the only solution is diplomatic,” Bar-Yaacov said. “A harsh military response risks dragging the region into further turmoil.”
Diplomatically, Israel’s response to the attack has mirrored that of its reaction to the earlier one, with its ambassador to the United Nations calling for a UN Security Council meeting on the matter, once again trying to marshall international opinion behind Israel, despite this latest strike being a response to Israel’s own.
Moreover, with Iran looking less likely to suffer any cost for its strike upon Israel, he risks widening the divisions in both his own cabinet and in Israeli society if no action is taken.
“If [Netanyahu] thinks DC will reject backing an assault on Iran itself, then attacks on scores of proxies simultaneously could be an alternative option,” Hellyer said.

In a statement on Saturday, Hamas, which governs the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, said it affirmed “the natural right” of countries and peoples in the Middle East to defend themselves “in the face of Zionist aggressions”.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Biden vows G7 response, ‘ironclad’ US support for Israel after Iran attackslist 2 of 4Israel’s army gives televised address after Iran attacklist 3 of 4The moment Iran fires hundreds of missiles, drones at Israellist 4 of 4Iran launches hundreds of missiles, drones in first direct attack on Israelend of list
“The military operation carried out by Iran against the Zionist entity is a natural right and a due response to the crime of targeting the consulate in Damascus,” it said.
The Iranian salvo, fired late on Saturday night, consisted of more than 300 cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones, according to the Israeli military. Some 99 percent of the projectiles were intercepted, an Israeli spokesman said, with help from France, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it launched the drones and missiles under Operation True Promise as part of the punishment for “the Zionist entity’s crime of targeting the Iranian consulate in Syria” on April 1.
The raid in Damascus killed 13 people, including two senior generals in the IRGC’s elite Quds Force.
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the consulate attack.
Iran’s mission to the United Nations said it now deemed the matter “concluded” and warned Israel of a “considerably more severe” response should the “Israeli regime make another mistake”.
It also warned the US to stay out of the conflict.
 



 
Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s joint chief of staff, was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency that Tehran has warned Washington its bases will be targeted if it backed an Israeli response.
Iran conveyed a message through the Swiss embassy that if the US participated “in further aggressive Zionist moves through its bases or military assets across the region, and this is proven to us, its bases and assets and personnel in the region will have no security”, he said.
The escalation comes six months into Israel’s latest war on Gaza, which began after Hamas’s unprecedented attacks in southern Israel on October 7. The brutal Israeli assault has killed at least 33,686 Palestinians and wounded 76,309 others in Gaza.
The bloodshed has driven up tensions in the region, spreading to fronts with Lebanon and Syria and drawing long-range fire at Israeli targets from as far away as Yemen and Iraq.
A number of countries in the West condemned Iran’s attack, with the UK saying it was working to stabilise the situation and France criticising Tehran for risking a “military escalation”. Egypt and Saudi Arabia called for restraint, while the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation”.
The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency session to discuss the attacks at Israel’s request.

“If the Zionist regime [Israel] or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response,” Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement on Sunday.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Iran launches hundreds of missiles, drones in first direct attack on Israellist 2 of 4Biden vows G7 response, ‘ironclad’ US support for Israel after Iran attackslist 3 of 4Hamas backs Iran after retaliatory missile, drone attacks on Israellist 4 of 4‘Serious escalation’: World reacts to Iran’s drone, missile raids on Israelend of list
Raisi’s statement follows a similar warning by Iranian military chief, Major-General Mohammad Bagheri, who told state TV that a “much larger” response awaits Israel “if it retaliates against Iran”.
Bagheri said the Iranian attack on Israel “has achieved all its goals, and in our view the operation has ended, and we do not intend to continue”.
Earlier on Sunday, he warned the US that any backing of Israeli retaliation would result in its bases being targeted by Iran.
However, in a signal that Iran’s response was calculated in an attempt to avoid any major escalation, the Iranian foreign minister Amir Abdollahian said that Tehran had informed the US of the planned attack 72 hours in advance, and said that the strikes would be “limited” and for self-defence.
 



 
That did not stop more aggressive language from other officials, with the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami, warning that Tehran would retaliate against any Israeli attacks on its interests, officials or citizens.
“From now on, whenever Israel attacks Iranian interests… we will attack from Iran.”
Meanwhile, Iran’s permanent mission to the United Nations justified Tehran’s response to Israeli “aggression” as a “legitimate defence” in accordance with the UN charter.
“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” said a statement.
It added that the US should “stay away” from the conflict, as it is an issue between Iran and Israel.
 



 
Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the Iranian attacks would be seen by its nationals as a “historic event in the country”.
“For over 40 years, Iran has been talking about going to war with Israel as one of its main adversaries,” she said, adding that celebrations were held in several Iranian cities over the air raids.
‘Significant response’
Tehran’s attacks late on Saturday were launched after a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 1 killed IRGC members, raising the threat of a wider regional conflict.
On Sunday, Israel reported modest damage and reopened its airspace following the unprecedented direct attack.
The Israeli military said the armed forces had shot down more than 99 percent of the Iranian drones and missiles and were discussing follow-up options.
 



 
In a brief statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, “We intercepted. We blocked. Together we will win.”
Meanwhile, Israel’s defence chief, Yoav Gallant, warned in a televised statement that the confrontation with Iran “is not over yet”.
Israel’s Channel 12 TV quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying there would be a “significant response” to the attack.
Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, also called Iran’s actions “very grave”, saying in a televised briefing that they “push the region toward escalation”.
Despite the rhetoric, one Iranian analyst said the statements coming from Iran offer an opening for the opposing parties to back off from a wider confrontation.
Farzan Sabet, a senior researcher at the Geneva-based Global Governance Centre, said Israel “has a potential off-ramp” by making a “largely symbolic and non- or only slightly lethal response”.
But given Israel’s “historically low threat tolerance and practice of disproportionate response”, further retaliations and escalations could be seen, he said in an analysis posted on X.

Biden cut short a trip to Delaware and returned to the US capital to meet advisers following the late Saturday night attack, the White House said in a statement.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Iran launches hundreds of missiles, drones in first direct attack on Israellist 2 of 3Iran’s IRGC seizes ‘Israeli-linked’ ship near Strait of Hormuzlist 3 of 3How high is the risk of conflict between Iran and Israel?end of list
The statement said that US forces and facilities had not been hit, adding that the US helped Israel in taking down “nearly all” of the attacking drones and missiles.
The US president also he reiterated the “ironclad” support for Israel’s security in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he has had strained relations over Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza.
“I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the White House quoted Biden as saying.
“Tomorrow, I will convene my fellow G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” he said.
Iran launched explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel late on Saturday in its first direct attack on Israeli territory, a retaliatory strike that raised the threat of a wider regional conflict.
Tehran had pledged to retaliate for Israel’s attack on Iran’s embassy compound last week in Damascus that killed a senior commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’s overseas Quds Force and six other officers.
 



 
‘Vigilant to all threats’
Biden said he had directed the US military to move aircraft and ballistic missile defence destroyers to the region over the past week.
“Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our service members, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” he said.
Biden said his team would coordinate with counterparts across the region and stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders.
“And while we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” he said.
Amid the tensions, US media reported that Biden is looking to de-escalate.
Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, James Bays, said that “behind the scenes, there is a great deal of pressure on Israel to show restraint.”
News outlet Axios said Biden told Netanyahu in the same phone call that he would oppose an Israeli counterattack against Iran, advising the Israeli leader that he should “take the win”.
NBC said he had also privately expressed concerns to others that Netanyahu was trying to drag th0e US more deeply into a broader conflict.
Meanwhile, CNN quoted a senior White House official as saying that Biden told Netanyahu that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran.
“If he [Biden] will have an all-out war, the economic effects of that, the oil price and other things would be so catastrophic” and “potentially” place his re-election effort in peril in November, Al Jazeera’s Bays said.
On Saturday, Biden met his top security officials in the White House Situation Room, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and CIA Director William Burns.
Biden had warned Iran against retaliation even while predicting that the attack was imminent.

The Israeli forces said in a statement early on Sunday the “vast majority” of missiles launched from Iran were intercepted outside of Israel’s borders.
Tensions between Israel and Iran have soared since Israel’s six-month war in the Gaza Strip.
Here is how the world reacted to Iran’s retaliatory attacks on Israel:
Argentina
The office of President Javier Milei expressed its “solidarity and unwavering commitment” to Israel in the face of the attacks.
It added that Argentina “emphatically supports the State of Israel in the defence of its sovereignty, especially against regimes that promote terror”, noting an Argentinian court recently held Iran responsible for bomb attacks on the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in the 1990s.

Brazil
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying it follows “with grave preoccupation” the news that Iranian drones and missiles were sent to Israel.
It noted that Brazil has been warning the international community, since the beginning of the war on Gaza that the conflict could spread throughout the region.
Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa that his country “unequivocally condemns Iran’s airborne attacks”, adding: “We stand with Israel.”
“After supporting Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime’s latest actions will further destabilise the region and make lasting peace more difficult,” he added.
China
China is deeply concerned about escalation after Iran’s attacks, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in remarks published on its website.
“China calls on relevant parties to remain calm and exercise restraint to avoid further escalation of tensions,” the spokesperson said in response to a question about Iran’s strikes.
This round of tensions is a “spillover from the Gaza conflict”, and quelling that conflict is “a top priority”, the spokesperson added.
Colombia
President Gustavo Petro called the attacks “predictable”, adding that “we’re now in the prelude to World War III precisely when humanity should rebuild its economy towards the rapid goal of decarbonisation”.
“The support of the US, in practice, for a genocide, has ignited the world. Everyone knows how wars start, no one knows how they end. If only the people of Israel were high enough, like their ancestors, to stop the madness of their ruler,” he said in a statement.
“The United Nations must meet urgently and must immediately commit to peace.”
Egypt
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its “deep concern” at the escalation of hostilities and called for “maximum restraint”.
Its statement also warned of the “risk of the regional expansion of the conflict”, and added that Egypt would be “in direct contact with all parties to the conflict to try and contain the situation”.
European Union
“The EU strongly condemns the unacceptable Iranian attack against Israel,” EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said in a post on X.
“This is an unprecedented escalation and a grave threat to regional security.”

France
Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said Iran is taking a “new step in its destabilising actions and taking the risk of a military escalation”.
Germany
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country would do everything possible to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.
“We can only warn Iran in particular. It is good that Israel, together with its partners, has largely repelled this attack,” he said in a statement on the social media platform X.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock condemned the attack which she said “could plunge an entire region into chaos.
Iran and its proxies must stop this immediately,” she said. “Israel offers our full solidarity at this time,” she added.
G7
After a video conference held by the Group of Seven (G7) leaders, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said the group “unanimously condemned” the drone and missile attack, but added that “all parties must exercise restraint”.
“We will continue all our efforts to work towards de-escalation. Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate ceasefire, will make a difference,” Michel added.
 
 



 
India
India said it was “seriously concerned at the escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran, which threatens the peace and security in the region”.
“We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of diplomacy,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.
India, it added, is closely monitoring the evolving situation and Indian embassies in the region are in close touch with the Indian community.
“It is vital that security and stability are maintained in the region,” the statement further said.
Jordan
Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh said any escalation in the region would lead to “dangerous paths” and said that there was a need to reduce escalation by all parties.
In remarks to the cabinet, Khasawneh said the country’s armed forces would confront any attempt by any party that sought to endanger the kingdom’s security.
Lebanon
Lebanese group Hezbollah praised Iran’s attack on Israel, describing it as a “brave” decision.
Iran-backed Hezbollah added in a statement that Iran had exercised its legal rights despite “threats, intimidation and pressure”.
Malaysia
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim dubbed Iran’s attack as a “consequence of the Israeli government breaking international laws” by bombing the Iranian consulate on April 1.
He said the violence between the two regional rivals was not “good for the world economy and peace,” local English daily Malay Mail reported.
“The war between Iran and Israel that started after the Zionist Israeli government attacked the Iranian embassy, which is against international law, is a consequence of one’s actions. When you break the law you invite a reaction.”
Pakistan
“Today’s developments demonstrate the consequences of the breakdown of diplomacy,” the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“These also underline the ‘grave’ implications in cases where the UN Security Council is unable to fulfil its responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security.”
For months, it added, Pakistan has underlined the necessity of international efforts to prevent expansion of hostilities in the region and for a cease-fire in Gaza.
“It’s now critically urgent to stabilise the situation and restore peace. We call on all parties to exercise utmost restraint,” it concluded.
Qatar
The Gulf nation called on all concerned parties to stop the escalation and exercise utmost restraint.
In a statement, the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed “its deep concern about the developments in the region”.
It called on “all parties to halt escalation, promote calm and exercise maximum restraint”.
It urged “the international community to take urgent action to defuse tension and de-escalate the situation in the region”.

Russia
Russia said it was extremely concerned by Iranian strikes on Israel and called on all parties to exercise restraint.
“We express our extreme concern over another dangerous escalation in the region,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the Iranian attacks. “We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint.”
“We have repeatedly warned that the numerous unresolved crises in the Middle East, primarily in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone, which are often fuelled by irresponsible provocative actions, will lead to an increase in tension,” the ministry said.
Saudi Arabia
The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement voicing its concern at the “military escalation” and calling on “all parties to exercise utmost restraint and spare the region and its peoples from the dangers of war”.
It went on to urge the UN Security Council “to assume its responsibility towards maintaining international peace and security”.
Spain
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for restraint, saying on X: “We are following with the greatest concern the evolution of the situation in the Middle East. One must at all cost avoid a regional escalation.”
 



 
Turkey
Turkey does not want further escalation of tension in the region after Iran’s drone and missile attack against Israel, Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told his Iranian counterpart in a phone call on Sunday, Turkish diplomatic sources told Reuters.
Anadolu Agency reported Fidan held a call with UK’s Cameron “adding that both officials agreed that the region should not see any further escalation”, according to diplomatic sources.
Ukraine
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Iran’s drone and missile attack, calling for efforts to prevent a further escalation in Middle East conflict.
“Iran’s actions threaten the entire region and the world, just as Russia’s actions threaten a larger conflict, and the obvious collaboration between the two regimes in spreading terror must face a resolute and united response from the world,” he posted on X.

Ukraine condemns Iran’s attack on Israel using “Shahed” drones and missiles. We in Ukraine know very well the horror of similar attacks by Russia, which uses the same “Shahed” drones and Russian missiles, the same tactics of mass air strikes.
Every effort must be made to prevent…

United Kingdom
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described Iran’s actions as “reckless”.
“Iran has once again demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard,” he said in a statement posted on X.
“The UK will continue to stand up for Israel’s security and that of all our regional partners, including Jordan and Iraq,” he added.

United Nations
“I strongly condemn the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran this evening,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a statement.
“I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation. I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East,” he added.
United States
President Joe Biden condemned the Iranian attacks and pledged a coordinated G7 diplomatic response. He said the US had helped Israel take down “nearly all” of the attacking drones and missiles.
Biden said in a statement released by the White House that he reiterated the “ironclad” US support for Israel’s security in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” he said in the statement.
“Tomorrow [Sunday], I will convene my fellow G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” he said.
The US also does not want to see an escalation of the conflict in the region and Biden made clear to Netanyahu that Washington would not participate in any offensive action against Iran, according to a senior administration official who was not authorised to publicly discuss the private conversation between the two leaders.
Vatican
Pope Francis made a “pressing appeal” against a “spiral of violence”, warning of a potential regional conflagration.
“I make a pressing appeal for an end to any action which could fuel a spiral of violence that risks dragging the Middle East into an even greater conflict,” the Argentinian pontiff declared following his traditional Sunday prayer in Saint Peter’s Square at the Vatican.
“I am praying and following with concern, but also pain, the news that has come in recent hours about the worsening situation in Israel due to Iran’s intervention,” the pope told worshippers.
“No one should threaten the existence of others. All countries must, however, side with peace and help Israelis and Palestinians to live in two states, side by side and in security,” he said.
Yemen
Yemen’s armed Houthi movement said on Sunday that Iran’s attack on Israel was a legitimate act in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on April 1.
A Houthi spokesman added that the Yemeni group had been in direct confrontation with Israel since October 7, by attacking the southern Israeli port of Eilat with missiles and drones and by preventing Israeli ships from sailing through the Red Sea.

Although any attack on a diplomatic mission is a clear violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Israeli leader proceeded, hoping to divert attention from his failures in the Israeli war on Gaza.
With Israel having previously carried out a series of assassinations against Iranian officials and scientists, this act was hard to deny. No other power in the region could conduct such a brazen violation of international law regarding the sanctity of diplomatic missions.
Coming on the heels of other Israeli attacks on Iranian targets in Syria, this was a provocative act aimed at establishing military hegemony in the region.
For their part, the Iranians were caught in a bind. The international response to the brazen Israeli defiance of international law was muted, especially in the West, and Tehran could no longer tolerate the Israeli provocations. Iran also has its own considerations of military deterrence in the region.
The result was an attack from Iranian territory, which sent a clear message to Israel and its allies. It demonstrated the Iranian capabilities but also provided space for de-escalation. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian described the attack as “limited” and said Tehran had warned the United States ahead of launching it.
Thanks to a deployment of US forces to the region and Israel’s own air defence capabilities, nearly all of the drones and missiles Iran launched were intercepted.
This display of military power by Israel and Iran has left the rest of the Arab world terrified of what another regional war could do to an already devastated region. And if it is to take place, there will be not just regional, but global repercussions. Any regional Iranian-Israeli conflict will pull in the Gulf countries, but also the US, Russia and China, creating a potentially explosive global confrontation.
As Israel and Iran are establishing this new “balance of terror”, the international community has to act. The United Nations Security Council must pass a strong binding resolution imposing a full ceasefire in the region that includes the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Iran and all neighboring countries involved, as well as non-state actors.
Importantly, this resolution must recognise that at the core of much of the instability in the region is the unresolved Palestinian question.
Therefore, it needs to call for an end to Israel’s genocidal invasion of Gaza and the exchange of captives. It must provide a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood and the end of the Israeli military control of all Arab territories occupied in 1967. It must create an international peacekeeping force that will ensure compliance by all parties, especially in Gaza but also in the West Bank, where settler violence has reached unprecedented levels.
A clear declaration in support of the Palestinian right to self-determination and a roadmap to its realisation is paramount now. Already most European countries have indicated their plans to join the list of 139 states that have recognised the state of Palestine.
This resolution should not repeat the mistakes of UNSC 2728 passed on March 25, which the US tried to undermine immediately by claiming that it was “nonbinding”. The resolution was binding but it lacked “teeth” – or clear measures to be undertaken in case of violation. That is why Israel ignored it.
A new resolution, therefore, will require the use of Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Article 41 of this chapter reads: “The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.”
The possibility of imposing biting sanctions and a diplomatic boycott on those who do not abide by its provisions must be made clear in the resolution. Mention must also be made of the other provisions in Chapter VII which include the use of military force to ensure maintenance of international peace.
For decades, Israel has gotten away with perpetrating egregious violations of international law because it has faced no consequences. Now the International Court of Justice has declared that Israeli actions in Gaza “plausibly” amount to genocide in Gaza. Israel will not stop its aggression in Gaza or elsewhere in the region unless it is faced with a credible threat of sanctions. Iran, for its part, already faces sanctions pressure from the West, but if China and other non-Western powers were to join such measures, it would think twice before violating the resolution.
With Iran clearly demonstrating it is willing to de-escalate after the attack, a small window of opportunity now exists for action. The US and other countries have come to the rescue of Israel and this means that it will have to pay back its allies by complying with the ceasefire.
Unless the world wants to deal with the economic and humanitarian catastrophe of a region-wide war in the Middle East, it must move quickly and lay the foundations for a comprehensive lasting peace in the region. The key to that is resolving the Palestinian question once and for all.

President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone call late on Sunday that the US would not take part in any retaliatory action in response to Iran’s air attack the previous day.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3UN Security Council meets after Iran launches attack on Israellist 2 of 3Israel ‘shouting from the rooftops’ to warn about Iranlist 3 of 3What does Israel want to do after Iran’s drone and missile attacks?end of list
Despite the US president joining global calls for restraint, the rising tensions in the Middle East look set to accelerate approval of a stalled funding package that would see Washington hand Netanyahu $14bn in aid.
“We believe Israel has freedom of action to protect itself and defend itself … That’s a longstanding policy and that remains, but no, we would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing,” a senior US administration official said on Sunday.
The Iranian attack, which came in response to a strike – as yet unclaimed by Israel – on Iran’s embassy in Syria on April 1, saw more than 300 missiles and drones launched towards Israel. However, it caused only modest damage, with most shot down by Israel, with help from the US, the United Kingdom, France and Jordan.
Israel’s five-member war cabinet, which met on Sunday evening, is reported to favour retaliation. However, division over the timing and scale of any response is said to persist.

In a statement issued late on Saturday, Biden said he had told Netanyahu that Israel had “demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks”. However, he did not reveal if Israel’s response was discussed.
John Kirby, the White House’s top national security spokesperson, sought to set out the US position clearly in an interview on the NBC channel on Sunday.
“Our commitment is ironclad” to defending Israel and to “helping Israel defend itself”, he said, before adding: “As the president has said many times, we don’t seek a wider war in the region. We don’t seek a war with Iran.”
Tough neighbourhood
However, the escalation of the low-level conflict that has been bubbling through Israel’s six-month bombardment of Gaza appears set to see US lawmakers push through a funding package that has been stalled.
Following a new plea from Biden, Republican lawmaker and House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that he will try to advance the $95bn package of wartime aid for US allies.

Johnson has been key in holding up approval of the national security package, which would hand $14bn to Israel and about $60bn to Ukraine, as well as sending funds to allies in Asia.
Johnson told Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures that he and Republicans “understand the necessity of standing with Israel” and he would try this week to advance the aid.
“The details of that package are being put together right now,” he said. “We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.”
Johnson is already under immense political pressure amid the Republican Party’s divided support for helping Kyiv defend itself from Russia’s invasion.
Kirby called on the speaker to put that package “on the floor as soon as possible”.
“We didn’t need any reminders in terms of what’s going on in Ukraine,” Kirby said. “But [Saturday night’s Iranian attack] certainly underscores significantly the threat that Israel faces in a very, very tough neighbourhood.”

Fighting and humanitarian crisis

Five people have been wounded in an Israeli air raid near the European Hospital south of the city of Khan Younis, the Wafa news agency reported on Sunday, quoting medical sources.
Displaced Palestinians trying to return to their homes in northern Gaza recounted being shot at by the Israeli army in a video verified by Al Jazeera on Sunday.
At least 33,729 Palestinians have been killed and 76,371 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel from Hamas’s October 7 attacks stands at 1,139, with dozens of people still held captive.

 



 
Diplomacy and geopolitical tensions

Early on Sunday, booms and air raid sirens sounded across Israel after Iran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a region-wide war.
In Washington, DC, President Joe Biden said US forces helped Israel down “nearly all” the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response. The US president is set to host Iraq’s leader this week for talks.
On Sunday, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called for de-escalation at a UN Security Council meeting to discuss Iran’s strikes on Israel.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN told the meeting his country was left with no choice but to act after the international community failed to denounce Israel’s attack on its embassy in Syria on April 1. The Israeli ambassador called for “all possible sanctions” against Iran, and said Tehran had crossed a “red line”.
A senior US official has confirmed that Biden told the Israeli prime minister Washington would not offer military support for any retaliation against Iran’s attack, according to a report by the AFP news agency on Sunday.
Separately, the US president urged congressional leaders on Sunday to pass a spending bill that includes $14bn in aid for Israel.
In the region, on Sunday, the US military said its Central Command forces successfully engaged and destroyed more than 80 “one-way attack” drones and at least six ballistic missiles intended to strike Israel from Iran and Yemen.
India also called on Iran to release 17 Indian crew members on board a container ship seized by Iran on Saturday.

 



 
Violence in the occupied West Bank

Israeli forces arrested eight people in early morning raids across the occupied West Bank, according to Wafa. Six people were arrested in raids near the city of Tulkarem, while two were arrested from Kafr Nima, west of the city of Ramallah, Wafa reported on Monday.
Israeli settlers uprooted 30 olive trees and several almond trees in the town of Qarawat Bani Hassan, west of Salfit, in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Wafa reported.

“CENTCOM remains postured to support Israel’s defense against these dangerous actions by Iran. We will continue to work with all our regional partners to increase regional security.”
CENTCOM made the announcement after Iran late on Saturday launched its first-ever attack on Israeli territory in retaliation for a suspected Israeli attack on its embassy in Syria.
The attack involving more than 300 drones and missiles caused only modest damage as most were shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence system or the US and its partners.

US President Joe Biden earlier praised US forces for their “extraordinary skill” in helping Israel take down “nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.”
Biden described US support for Israel’s self-defence as “ironclad” but warned that Washington would not join any retaliatory action taken by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government against Tehran.
US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said US forces “remain postured to protect US troops and partners in the region, provide further support for Israel’s defence, and enhance regional stability.”
The threat of all-out war between Israel and Iran has put the region on tenterhooks, prompting calls for restraint from Middle Eastern neighbours and major powers.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday warned that the Middle East was on “the brink”.
“The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,” Guterres told a UN Security Council meeting convened in response to the Iranian attack.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the adversaries at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Sunday not to further escalate tension in the region with further attacks, following mutual air attacks over the past two weeks. However, Iran and Israel concentrated on accusing one another of being a threat to peace.Keep reading list of 3 itemslist 1 of 3Iran claims ‘right to self-defence’ in Israel attacklist 2 of 3US military says it destroyed dozens of drones fired from Iran, Yemenlist 3 of 3US: Iran ‘will be held responsible’ for further attacksend of list
“Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” Guterres told the meeting. “Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate.
“It’s time to step back from the brink,” he declared.
Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel late on Saturday. The war in Gaza has triggered regular clashes between Iran’s regional allies – such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis – and Israel. The direct attack, a retaliation to a strike – still unclaimed by Israel – on Iran’s embassy compound in Syria on April 1, marked a serious escalation.
At the meeting, Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the UN, called on the 15-member body to unequivocally condemn Iran’s attack. He insisted that the UNSC has an obligation to not let Iran’s actions go unanswered and that the United States will explore additional measures in the coming days to hold Iran accountable.
“Let me be clear: if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible,” he said.
 



 
Heated exchange
Heated words were exchanged between Iran and Israel at the meeting, with their representatives calling on the council to impose sanctions on one another.
Iran’s UN ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country’s action against Israel was necessary and proportionate.
He claimed that the UNSC “failed in its duty to maintain international peace and security” because it did not condemn the Israeli attack on its diplomatic mission in Syria.
Tehran “had no choice” but to respond, he declared, adding that his country does “not seek escalation or war” but will respond to any “threat or aggression”.
“It is time for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and address the real threat to international peace and security,” Iravani said, urging it to “take urgent and punitive measures to compel this regime [Israel] to stop a genocide against the people of Gaza”.
Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan told the meeting that Iran is “the number one global sponsor of terror” and a “pirate state”.
“The mask has come off and so the world’s complacency must also fall,” he continued. “The only option is to condemn Iran … and ensure that it knows that the world will no longer stand idle.”
“This attack crossed every red line and Israel reserves the right to retaliate,” he stated.
Erdan called on the UNSC to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran’s elite military outfit, a terrorist organisation and to “impose all possible sanctions on Iran before it’s too late”.
The rising tensions between Iran and Israel come against the backdrop of Israel’s six-month-old war on Gaza, which began after Hamas’s October 7 attack in Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,139 people, mostly civilians.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,729 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health.

He said only a global effort could stop a new era of 'cyberterrorism' [File: Baz Ratner/ Reuters]Published On 15 Apr 202415 Apr 2024Israel’s leaders have signalled that they are weighing their options on how to respond to Iran’s attack early Sunday morning, when Tehran targeted its archenemy with more than 300 missiles and drones.
Iran’s attack, which followed an Israeli strike last week on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, that killed 13 people was historic: It was the first time Tehran had directly targeted Israeli soil, despite decades of hostility. Until Sunday, many of Iran’s allies in the so-called axis of resistance — especially the Palestinian group Hamas, the Lebanese group Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthis and armed groups in Iraq and Syria — were the ones who launched missiles and drones at Israel.
But if Israel were to hit back militarily inside Iran, it wouldn’t be the first time. Far from it.
For years, Israel has focused on one target within Iran in particular: the country’s nuclear programme. Israel has long accused Iran of clandestinely building a nuclear bomb that could threaten its existence — and has publicly, and frequently, spoken of its diplomatic and intelligence-driven efforts to derail those alleged efforts. Iran denies that it has had a military nuclear programme, while arguing that it has the right to access civil nuclear energy.
As Israel prepares its response, here’s a look at the range of attacks in Iran — from drone strikes and cyberattacks to assassinations of scientists and the theft of secrets — that Israel has either accepted it was behind or is accused of having orchestrated.
Assassinations of Iranian scientists

January 2010: A physics professor at Tehran University, Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, was killed through a remote-controlled bomb planted in his motorcycle. Iranian state media claimed that the US and Israel were behind the attack. The Iranian government described Ali-Mohammadi as a nuclear scientist.
November 2010: A professor at the nuclear engineering faculty at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, Majid Shahriari, was killed in a car explosion on his way to work. His wife was also wounded. The president of Iran at the time, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, blamed the United States and Israel for the attacks.
January 2012: Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a chemical engineering graduate, was killed by a bomb placed on his car by a motorcyclist in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel and the US for the attack and said Ahmadi Roshan was a nuclear scientist who supervised a department at Iran’s primary uranium enrichment facility, in the city of Natanz.
November 2020:Prominent nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed in a roadside attack outside Tehran. Western and Israeli intelligence had long suspected that Fakhrizadeh was the father of an Iranian nuclear weapons programme. He was sanctioned by the United Nations in 2007 and the US in 2008.
May 2022: Colonel Hassan Sayyad Khodaei of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was shot five times outside of his home in Tehran. Majid Mirahmadi, a member of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, alleged the assassination was “definitely the work of Israel”.

Israel’s cyberattacks on Iran

June 2010:The Stuxnet virus was found in computers at the nuclear plant in Iran’s Bushehr city, and it spread from there to other facilities. As many as 30,000 computers across at least 14 facilities were impacted by September 2010. At least 1,000 out of 9,000 centrifuges in Iran’s Natanz enrichment facility were destroyed, according to an estimate by the Institute for Science and International Security. Upon investigation, Iran blamed Israel and the US for the virus attack.
April 2011: A virus called Stars was discovered by the Iranian cyberdefence agency which said the malware was designed to infiltrate and damage Iran’s nuclear facilities. The virus mimicked official government files and inflicted “minor damage” on computer systems, according to Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran’s Passive Defense Organization. Iran blamed Israel and the US.
November 2011: Iran said it discovered a new virus called Duqu, based on Stuxnet. Experts said Duqu was intended to gather data for future cyberattacks. The Iranian government announced it was checking computers at main nuclear sites. The Duqu spyware was widely believed by experts to have been linked to Israel.
April 2012: Iran blamed the US and Israel for malware called Wiper, which erased the hard drives of computers owned by the Ministry of Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company.
May 2012: Iran announced that a virus called Flame had tried to steal government data from government computers. The Washington Post reported that Israel and the US had used it to collect intelligence. Then-Israeli Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon did not confirm the nation’s involvement but acknowledged that Israel would use all means to “harm the Iranian nuclear system”.
October 2018: The Iranian government said that it had blocked an invasion by a new generation of Stuxnet, blaming Israel for the attack.
October 2021: A cyberattack hit the system that allows Iranians to use government-issued cards to purchase fuel at a subsidised rate, affecting all 4,300 petrol stations in Iran. Consumers had to either pay the regular price, more than double the subsidised one, or wait for stations to reconnect to the central distribution system. Iran blamed Israel and the US.
May 2020: A cyberattack impacted computers that control maritime traffic at Shahid Rajaee port on Iran’s southern coast in the Gulf, creating a hold-up of ships that waited to dock. The Washington Post quoted US officials as saying that Israel was behind the attack, though Israel did not claim responsibility.

Israel’s drone strikes and raids on Iran

January 2018: Mossad agents raided a secure Tehran facility, stealing classified nuclear archives. In April 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel discovered 100,000 “secret files that prove” Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons programme.
February 2022: Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett admitted in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal in December 2023, that Israel carried out an attack on an unmanned aerial vehicle, and assassinated a senior IRGC commander in February of the previous year.
May 2022: Explosives-laden quadcopter suicide drones hit the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran, killing an engineer and damaging a building where drones had been developed by the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces. IRGC Commander Hossein Salami pledged retaliation against unspecified “enemies”.
January 2023: Several suicide drones struck a military facility in central Isfahan, but they were thwarted and caused no damage. While Iran did not immediately place blame for the attacks, Iran’s UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, wrote a letter to the UN chief saying that “primary investigation suggested Israel was responsible”.
February 2024: A natural gas pipeline in Iran was attacked. Iran’s Oil Minister Javad Owji alleged that the “explosion of the gas pipeline was an Israeli plot”.

Washington
CNN
         — 
    


            The US expects that Iran will carry out strikes against multiple targets inside Israel in the coming days and is prepared to help intercept any weapons launched at its ally, sources tell CNN, as the Biden administration is on high alert for what could be the eruption of a significantly volatile and unpredictable period in the Middle East.
    

President Joe Biden on Friday predicted that Iran’s attacks were coming “sooner than later” and sought to once again issue a stern public warning, saying that his message to Tehran was simply: “Don’t.”
    

            The beginning of a state-on-state conflict between Iran and Israel would mark a serious escalation in the region – a scenario that the US has hoped to avoid since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.
    

            As of late Friday, the US believed that Iranian proxies could also be involved in the forthcoming attacks, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the intelligence, and that targets would likely be both inside Israel and around the region. The US’ readiness to intercept weapons launched at Israel marked a clear indication of the level of ongoing cooperation between the two militaries.
    

            The US had observed Iran moving military assets around internally, including drones and cruise missiles, signaling that it was preparing to attack Israeli targets from inside its own territory, according to two people familiar with US intelligence. One of the people said that the US had observed Iran readying as many as 100 cruise missiles.
    

            It was not clear whether Iran was preparing to strike from its soil as part of an initial attack, or if it was posturing to try to deter Israel or the US from conducting a possible counter strike on its territory.
    

            At the White House Friday, Biden — responding to shouted questions from reporters including whether US troops were at risk — emphasized his administration’s commitment to Israel’s security.
    

            “We are devoted to the defense of Israel,” he said. “We will support Israel we will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed.”
    

            There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said Friday, following Israel’s attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria last week that killed three Iranian generals.
    

            Biden, who warned this week that Iran was threatening a “significant attack” on Israel, has been receiving constant updates on the situation from his national security team.
    

            The US and several other countries, including Britain and France, issued new travel guidelines for government employees in Israel as the Iranian threat loomed.
    

            “We’re watching this very, very closely,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, who declined to provide information about the expected timing of the threat.
    

            US Navy forces in the Red Sea have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen towards Israel. US forces in Iraq and Syria could also potentially intercept drones and rockets targeting northern Israel, depending on the location from which they’re launched.
    

            The Defense Department is also moving additional assets to the Middle East region “to bolster regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for US forces,” a US defense official told CNN, as Israel and the US brace for a potential Iranian attack.
    

            The Pentagon has been working specifically to bolster air defenses for the US troops stationed in Iraq and Syria who came under attack by Iran-backed proxy forces over 100 times between October and February. In January, three US servicemembers were killed when a drone got through US air defenses at the Tower 22 base in Jordan.
    

            The US is not anticipating that Iran or its proxies will attack US forces as part of its retaliation but is moving the assets just in case.
    

            “It would be imprudent if we didn’t take a look at our own posture in the region to make sure that we’re properly prepared,” Kirby said.
    

            CNN reported last week that the US was on high alert and actively preparing for an attack by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region. Officials said such an attack could come within the week.
    

    Sources say Iran wary of dramatic escalation


            CNN reported earlier this week that an Iranian attack on Israel would likely be carried out by Iranian proxy forces in the region rather than by Iran directly, according to two people familiar with US intelligence on the matter.
    

            Tehran is wary of a dramatic escalation in the fighting, the sources said, and does not want to give the US or its allies an excuse to attack Iran directly.
    

            The sources said Iran and its proxy militia groups do not appear poised to attack US troops or other assets in the region, but they noted that Iran does not have perfect command and control over all its proxy forces, so the possibility of an attack on US assets cannot be completely ruled out.
    

            The sources told CNN that US intelligence assesses that Iran has urged several of its proxy militia groups to simultaneously launch a large-scale attack against Israel, using drones and missiles, and that they could attack as soon as this week.
    

            “The threat is very clear and credible,” said one of the sources. “They have put the pieces in place to conduct the attack now. Just waiting for the right time.”
    

            Biden spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about the threat of an Iranian attack during a telephone call last week.
    

            A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East. Such a strike could lead to the Israel-Hamas war broadening into a wider, regional conflict – something Biden has long sought to avoid.
    

            Biden is receiving briefings multiple times a day on the situation, Kirby said.
    

            Kirby said Friday that US officials were in “constant communication” with their Israeli counterparts about the matter and that steps were underway to ensure Israel is able to defend itself.
    

            “We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel,” Kirby said Friday.
    

            He pointed to a visit to Israel on Friday by US Central Command chief Gen. Erik Kurilla to have “those conversations directly with his IDF counterparts.”
    

            Kurilla’s trip to Israel was moved up because of the expectation of an Iranian response to Israel’s targeting of the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria last week.
    

            There have also been a number of conversations in which US officials have urged Israel not to escalate the situation in retaliating against Iran, according to one of the US officials said.
    

            Separately, US officials were frustrated with their Israeli counterparts over the lack of information Israel shared prior to carrying out the strike in Damascus last week, sources told CNN. Israel only informed a US official when its planes were already in the air en route to Syria, another US official said.
    

            “We were not aware that Israel was going to carry out this airstrike in advance,” the official said. “Minutes before it happened and when Israeli planes were already in the air, Israel reached out to a U.S. official to say they were in the process of conducting a strike in Syria. It did not include any details on who they were targeting or where it would be conducted, and the strike was already underway before word could be passed through the U.S. government.”
    

    Diplomatic pressure


            Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the foreign ministers of Turkey, China and Saudi Arabia to urge them to press Iran not to escalate the conflict in the Middle East after threats made by Iran against Israel, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday.
    

            Miller said the US has also “engaged with European allies and partners over the past few days” to deliver a similar message on Iran. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron have both spoken to the Iranian foreign minister in recent days.
    

            Blinken “has been making clear to every country that has any semblance of a relationship with Iran that it is in their interest to use that relationship to send a message to Iran that they should not escalate this conflict. But I will let those countries speak for themselves about what action they may or may not take,” Miller said.
    

            The US State Department has restricted the travel of US government personnel in Israel in the wake of public threats against Israel by Iran.
    

            “Out of an abundance of caution, U.S. government employees and their family members are restricted from personal travel outside the greater Tel Aviv (including Herzliya, Netanya, and Even Yehuda), Jerusalem, and Be’er Sheva areas until further notice,” a security alert posted by the US Embassy Thursday said, “U.S. government personnel are authorized to transit between these three areas for personal travel.”
    

            “The security environment remains complex and can change quickly depending on the political situation and recent events,” the alert noted.
    

            France has advised its citizens to “absolutely refrain” from traveling to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories due to the risk of “military escalation,” the French Foreign Ministry said Friday.
    

            The ministry added that families of diplomatic staff in the Iranian capital Tehran will be returned to France and civil servants will be banned from work missions to those countries and territories.
    

            The French foreign minister issued the new recommendation following a crisis meeting on the region, the ministry said in a post on X.

Asked Friday what his message was to Tehran, US President Joe Biden said: “Don’t.”At least one Palestinian was killed after hundreds of armed Israeli settlers stormed a village in the occupied West Bank, setting fire to homes and cars in one of the largest attacks by settlers this year, according to local officials.Israel said its warplanes targeted ""military buildings"" used by Hezbollah fighters in parts of southern Lebanon on Friday. Hezbollah subsequently fired about 40 rockets toward northern Israel.Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link34 PostsSort byLatestOldestDropdown arrow12:18 a.m. ET, April 13, 2024Our live coverage of Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza has moved here.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link10:43 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024USAID worker killed in Israel, agency saysFrom CNN's Jennifer HanslerA staff member with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) died Friday in the Israeli port city of Jaffa, the agency announced.The male staffer was with USAID’s West Bank and Gaza mission, the agency said in a brief statement.USAID did not provide details on the circumstances around his death or his identity or citizenship.“He was a dedicated member of our team for more than two decades, and our thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues,” USAID said. USAID is working with the US Embassy to work out details about the fatal incident and its follow-up investigation, it said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link9:32 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024US expects Iran to carry out direct strikes against targets inside Israel, sources sayFrom CNN's MJ Lee and Natasha BertrandThe United States currently expects Iran will carry out strikes against multiple targets inside Israel and that Iranian proxies could also be involved in carrying out the attacks, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the intelligence.  The targets would likely be both inside Israel and around the region.The beginning of a state-on-state conflict between Iran and Israel would mark a serious escalation in the region that the US has hoped to avoid.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link8:49 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024US sees Iran moving military assets including drones and cruise missiles, sources sayFrom Natasha Bertrand and Oren LiebermannThe US observed Iran moving military assets around internally, including drones and cruise missiles, signaling that it is possibly preparing to attack Israeli targets from inside its own territory, according to two people familiar with US intelligence. It is not clear whether Iran is preparing to strike from its soil as part of an initial attack, or if it is posturing to try to deter Israel or the US from conducting a possible counter strike on its territory. One of the people said the US had observed Iran readying as many as 100 cruise missiles.Some context: The Iranians want their retaliatory strike on Israel — a response to the Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate last week in Damascus — to be ""significant,"" one of the people familiar with the intelligence said. But they also want to avoid getting embroiled in a direct war with Israel and the US, CNN has reported, which is why US intelligence has assessed that Iran may use its proxy forces to launch the first attack.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link8:25 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Israeli settlers storm village in West Bank and kill at least 1 Palestinian.

Issam Rimawi/Anadolu/Getty ImagesHundreds of armed Israeli settlers stormed a village in the occupied West Bank on Friday, setting fire to several homes and cars — and leaving at least one Palestinian dead — in one of the largest attacks by settlers this year, according to Palestinian officials. The settlers attacked Al-Mughayyir village, east of Ramallah, raided homes and fired gunshots at residents, according to Amin Abu-Alia, the head of the village council. Videos obtained by CNN show parts of the village burning, with smoke billowing over several buildings and settlers lobbing rocks. Houses and cars are seen completely burnt up, with sounds of gunfire and clashes heard in the background.Here are other headlines you should know:More Israeli attacks: An Israeli airstrike early Friday killed at least 29 people and injured dozens more after troops targeted a house belonging to the well-known Al-Tabatibi family in eastern Gaza City, according to a local health official. Israeli forces also surrounded and attacked the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, wounding several journalists and at least one other person. And in the occupied West Bank, troops killed two Hamas members in a raid on the city of Tubas, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.Hezbollah-Israel clashes: Around 40 rockets were fired from Lebanon on Friday evening, according to the Israeli military. Some were intercepted and the rest fell in open areas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. Israeli warplanes also carried out several airstrikes on Friday, targeting ""military buildings"" used by Hezbollah fighters in parts of southern Lebanon, the IDF said. Iranian threats: US President Joe Biden told reporters Friday he expects an attack from Iran will happen “sooner than later,"" with the White House adding that there is a ""very credible"" threat of Iranian retaliatory strikes against Israel. Additionally, the US Defense Department is moving additional assets to the Middle East region, a defense official told CNN, as the US and Israel brace for the potential attack. Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Central Command Commander Gen. Erik Kurilla on Friday discussed preparations for the potential attack. Warnings amid Iranian threats: France, Germany, Canada and the United States are among countries that are warning their citizens not to travel to the region due to the threat of an Iranian attack against Israel. Humanitarian aid: The Israeli military does not understand how humanitarian operations work, a top United Nations official said Friday, maintaining there is a ""degree of mistrust"" that needs to be resolved between the IDF and nongovernmental organizations on the ground in Gaza.Sanctions: The European Council has adopted sanctions against three Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad entities, in light of ""their responsibilities in the brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks"" that occurred across Israel on October 7. The US is also sanctioning four leaders of Hamas’ cyber and drone operations based in Gaza and Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced on Friday. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link5:33 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024US will attempt to intercept launches at Israel if feasible, US officials sayFrom CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha BertrandThe US will attempt to intercept any weapons launched at Israel if it’s feasible to do so, two US officials told CNN, in an indication of the level of ongoing cooperation between the two militaries before an anticipated Iranian attack.US Navy forces in the Red Sea have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen toward Israel. US forces in Iraq and Syria could also potentially intercept drones and rockets targeting northern Israel, depending on the location from which they’re launched.Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, has been in Israel meeting with the country’s security leadership. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, met with Kurilla.There have been a number of conversations where US officials have urged Israel not to escalate the situation in retaliating against Iran, according to one of the US officials. Remember: An Iranian attack is expected in response to Israel’s deadly strike of Tehran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, last week.The Damascus attack was the latest incident to stoke fears of a wider regional conflict breaking out in the Middle East during Israel's campaign in Gaza.Diplomatic efforts: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held a slew of calls to foreign counterparts aimed at pressuring Iran not to attack Israel.The top US diplomat spoke with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Friday, according to a readout from State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Blinken also spoke with the Turkish, Chinese and Saudi foreign ministers in recent days, Miller said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link9:25 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Israeli settlers kill at least 1 Palestinian while storming West Bank villageFrom CNN’s Kareem Khadder and Zeena Saifi in Jerusalem and CNN’s Benjamin Brown in LondonA view of damaged houses and burning vehicles after a raid by Israeli settlers on a town near Ramallah, West Bank on April 12. Issam Rimawi/Anadolu/Getty ImagesHundreds of armed Israeli settlers stormed a village in the occupied West Bank on Friday, setting fire to several homes and cars in one of the largest attacks by settlers this year, according to Palestinian officials. At least one Palestinian man was killed when shots were fired by Israeli settlers in the village of Al-Mughayyir, east of Ramallah, according to the head of the village council Amin Abu-Alia. He said he identified the killed Palestinian as his 26-year-old relative named Jihad Abu-Alia, who was meant to get married this summer.At least 25 others were injured in the rampage, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, the scale of which has not been seen since hundreds of settlers stormed through the villages of Turmusayya and Huwara in two separate incidents last year. Between 1,000 and 1,200 settlers surrounded the village, and around 500 stormed it just after midday local time on Friday, blocking all the roads in the area, Abu-Alia told CNN. He added that Israeli security forces informed Palestinian officials that the settlers were looking for a 14-year-old Israeli boy who had gone missing earlier in the day.They attacked the village, raided homes and fired gunshots at residents, Abu-Alia said. Videos obtained by CNN show parts of the village burning, with smoke billowing over several buildings and settlers lobbing rocks. Houses and cars are seen completely burnt up, with sounds of gunfire and clashes heard in the background.According to Abu-Alia, the Israeli military arrived at the scene at around 3 p.m. and didn’t stop the settlers from attacking the village. Israeli soldiers allowed them to raid homes, prevented Palestinian residents from moving around and blocked ambulances from reaching the injured, he added.  Abu-Alia told CNN settlers stole approximately 70 sheep from the Palestinian village.In response to a question by CNN, the IDF said “violent riots were instigated in multiple locations in the area” following the search for the boy.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3:48 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Israel says airstrikes targeted Hezbollah targets in southern LebanonIsraeli warplanes carried out several airstrikes on Friday, targeting ""military buildings"" used by Hezbollah fighters in parts of southern Lebanon, according to the Israel Defense Forces.The areas include the Aita al-Shaab and the Taybeh in southern Lebanon, said Avichay Adraee, IDF spokesperson for Arab media, in a post on X.""During the day, several shells were fired from Lebanon towards the Upper Galilee region, without causing any casualties. IDF forces attacked the sources of fire,"" Adraee added. The Israeli airstrikes were before the 40 rockets that were launched from Lebanon toward northern Israel Friday evening and claimed by Hezbollah.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3:53 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Biden expects an attack from Iran will happen ""sooner than later""From CNN's Samantha WaldenbergUS President Joe Biden gives remarks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus on Friday in Washington, DC.  Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden expects an attack from Iran will happen “sooner than later,""  he told reporters at the White House Friday. “I don’t want to get into secure information but my expectation is sooner than later,” Biden said when asked how imminent an attack on Israel was. Asked what his message to Tehran is right now, the president said “Don’t.”In response to more shouted questions from reporters asking if American troops were at risk, Biden returned to the podium and said that the United States is ""devoted” to the defense of Israel. “We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” Biden said. Remember: The United States says it is on high alert for a significant Iranian retaliatory attack following Israel's deadly strike on Tehran's consulate in Damascus last week, raising fears of a wider regional war. There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said earlier Friday, following Israel’s attack on a diplomatic compound in Syria that killed three Iranian generals.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

Exclusive: First-hand look at Israel's other war

Kafr Kila, Lebanon
CNN
         — 
    


            Shredded Lebanese and Hezbollah flags tower over a destroyed boardwalk where a panoramic view of Israel’s Upper Galilee stretches out for miles.
    

            “Buses (of people) used to come here just to see the Holy Land,” says Lt. Col. Juan Garcia Martinez, part of Spain’s peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon.
    

            CNN was embedded on Friday with a Spanish battalion on patrol of Lebanon’s southern border area, transformed by six months of crossfire between Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces.
    

            Craters pepper the roads and debris covers the sidewalks. Apart from a few Christian-majority villages that have largely been spared Israeli fire, the area is full of ghost towns — a mirror image of the northern-region of Israel where tens of thousands of residents have fled the fighting.

            More than 30,000 people have been displaced from the Lebanese area in the immediate perimeter of the 49-mile border, according to local authorities. Only one school remains functioning. More than 300 people — mostly fighters — have died in Israeli strikes. Eight civilians have been killed in Hezbollah attacks in northern Israel since last October. There have been Israeli soldier deaths in the cross-fire though the IDF has not provided an official tally.
    

            Minutes after the CNN team left the operations area of the UN mission in Lebanon (known as UNIFIL), Lebanon’s state news agency reported that machine guns were fired from Israel at a car belonging to local journalists. The Israeli military has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            A flare-up ensued, more intense than the usual daily exchange of fire, and more consequential due to a possible Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel expected as soon as this weekend.
    

            Hezbollah — the most powerful non-state actor in the region — coordinates closely with Iran. Mohammad Reza Zahidi, one of two high-ranking Iranian commanders killed in the April 1 airstrike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, was a key intermediary between Iran’s revolutionary guards and Hezbollah.
    

            Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths. That raised the specter of a conflict regional in scope and possibly catastrophic in its aftermath.

            Speculation swirled about whether Hezbollah would take part in Iran’s expected attack. But a Lebanese source familiar with the matter ruled this out. The attack will be “purely Iranian,” the source said.
    

            US intelligence appears to tally with this. The US has observed Iran moving military assets around inside its own country, including drones and cruise missiles, signaling a possible attack on Israeli targets from inside its territory, according to two people familiar with US intelligence.
    

            The US expects Iran to carry out direct strikes against targets inside Israel, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the intelligence.
    

            Hezbollah may only be compelled to join an Iranian war effort if the strike leads to further escalation, the same Lebanese source said. Hezbollah and other Iran-backed paramilitaries “will be prepared for the stage that comes after the Iranian response,” the source told CNN.
    

            On Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei appeared before a crowd wielding a rifle as he reiterated vows of revenge. Israel has been in a heightened state of alert since April 1. The widespread apprehension prompted officials there to urge people to refrain from stocking up on food, generators and medicine, as the country braces for the response.
    

            Still, US officials expect Iran’s attack to be calibrated to avoid a regional war. Meanwhile, Iran will seek to reassert itself as a regional force to be reckoned with, analysts say.
    

            “The broader objective for Iran seems to be one of de-escalation,” wrote Sina Toosi, a DC-based Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, in a post on X, “Tehran’s strategy aims to incrementally increase the repercussions for Israeli aggression, thereby deterring future incidents without escalating to an all-out war.”
    

            Iran has sought to walk that tightrope since it first entered the fray of the Iran-Hamas war in October. Its paramilitary partners — including Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis who have repeatedly struck a key Red Sea shipping route — link their battles to the war in Gaza.
    

            “We repeat, if it ends in Gaza, then it ends here,” Nasrallah said in a speech last week.
    

            Yet the conflict in Lebanon increases in complexity the longer Israel’s offensive in Gaza goes on.
    






Kafr Kila is a town that is - for the most part - deserted, and one that has borne the brunt of Israeli airstrikes in a series of back and forth exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah.

            When warnings about a possible Iranian attack reached fever pitch on Friday night, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets at Israel’s Upper Galilee, producing slew of intercepts from Israel’s anti-missile Iron Dome system.
    

            It provided a glimpse of how Hezbollah might attempt to overwhelm Israel’s defensive systems as Iran conducts its expected attack.
    

            The flighting on the Lebanon-Israel border has also re-opened long festering issues over the frontier, known as the blue line.
    

            Over the last six months, negotiations over the armistice line between Lebanon and Israel – imposed by the United Nations in 2000 after Hezbollah forced out a 22-year Israeli occupation – have been revived. Meanwhile, Western leaders have mounted pressure on Lebanon’s government to pull Hezbollah from the border area.

            Hezbollah’s supporters say this is far-fetched, and, at best,  unenforceable. But this diplomatic can of worms could protract the conflict in Lebanon.
    

            From one of Spain’s bases near the demarcation line, there is a clear view of a microcosm of Lebanon’s long-standing border issues with Israel.
    

            A verdant green field sowed with mines separates the base from the town of al-Ghajar. The blue line can be seen cutting through the town and splitting it in two. During the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, Israel occupied the rest of the village — a UN watchtower marks the tip of the Israeli-occupied territory.
    

            “We are soldiers. We have to constantly adapt to the changing situation,” said Captain Hector Alonso from a viewing point overseeing Ghajar. Asked if Alonso’s unit was prepared for the growing danger of the present moment, he said: “We are prepared.”

         — 
    


            Hundreds of Israeli settlers surrounded Palestinian villages and attacked residents across the occupied West Bank, eyewitnesses told CNN, after an Israeli boy who had gone missing from a settlement was found dead.
    

            The body of Binyamin Achimair, 14, was found in the area of Malachei Ha’Shalom, with the Israeli military saying he was killed in a “terrorist attack.”
    

            It is unclear yet what was the cause of death, and the IDF is yet to provide evidence that this was a “terrorist attack.” CNN has reached out for clarity.
    

            Soon after, videos obtained by CNN show settlers setting houses and cars ablaze in the village of Duma, southeast of Nablus. Footage shows heavy smoke engulfing the air, as settlers fire gunshots in the area. Eyewitnesses said settlers stormed people’s houses, resulting in clashes with Palestinians.
    

            In one video obtained by CNN from Duma, one man described the situation as a “street war.”
    

            Videos on social media show clashes between Palestinians and settlers in the villages of Deir Dibwan and Beitin, east of Ramallah. Palestinians are seen lobbing rocks at the settlers, and Israeli military vehicles firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.
    

            The latest attacks by settlers come a day after a large-scale attack in the village of Al-Mughayyir east of Ramallah, leaving one Palestinian man dead, amid the search for Achimair. About 25 others were also injured in the rampage, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that authorities were searching for whoever killed Achimair, urging Israelis to not obstruct them.
    

            “The abominable murder of the boy Binyamin Achimair, may God avenge his blood, is a serious crime. I send my heartfelt condolences to his family,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s office (PMO) said in a statement.
    

            “IDF and Shin Bet forces are in an extensive pursuit of the despicable murderers and all those who cooperated with them,” it continued.

            The prime minister said Israeli security forces carry out “intense operational and intelligence activity” in the area and in Palestinian villages, urging the citizens of Israel to allow them to “do their work unhindered”.
    

            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday urged the public to avoid taking the law into their own hands.
    

            “I appeal to the public, let the security forces act quickly in the hunt for the terrorists - revenge actions will make it difficult for our fighters in their mission - the law must not be taken into one’s hands,” Gallant said in a post on X.
    

            Videos obtained by CNN show increased Israeli military presence at a checkpoint near the town of Sinjil, northeast of Ramallah.
    

            The Palestinian Red Crescent said in a statement Saturday that over a dozen Palestinians arrived at hospitals across the West Bank, most wounded by gunfire.
    

            Violence has been rising in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since the October 7 attacks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah says at least 462 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or in settler attacks.

      Iranian navy seizes Israel-linked container ship amid escalating tensions in Middle East

CNN
         — 
    


            Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seized an Israeli-linked container ship in a helicopter operation near the Strait of Hormuz, state news agency IRNA reported, with tensions already high after Iran warned it would retaliate for a suspected Israeli strike on its consulate in Syria.
    

            IRNA reported that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy seized the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries, which is now being “directed back to Iranian territorial waters.”
    

            According to IRNA, the vessel is managed by the Zodiac Maritime, a company linked to Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.
    

            Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) has confirmed the seizure, saying there are 25 crew on board. Portugal’s government said that it was in touch with the Iranian authorities.
    

            The Strait of Hormuz, at the northern end of the Gulf of Oman, is the biggest oil chokepoint in the world. About 20% of the world’s daily consumption of oil passes through it every day.
    

            Iran has carried out similar seizures before. In January, Tehran seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman and transferred it to an Iranian port in response to the United States confiscating the same vessel and its oil last year.
    

            Tensions in the region are heightened after the strike on Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus, which killed seven officials including a top IRGC commander, and the seizure comes against the backdrop of the conflict in Gaza.
    

            The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have frequently been targeting shipping in the Red Sea area, while there have been regular exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel along Lebanon’s southern border.
    

            The United States currently expects Iran will carry out strikes against multiple targets inside Israel and that Iranian proxies could also be involved in carrying out the attacks, sources say, in what would mark a major escalation.
    

            US President Joe Biden on Friday predicted that Iran’s attacks were coming “sooner rather than later” and sought to once again issue a stern public warning, saying that his message to Tehran was simply: “Don’t.”
    

            In a video statement released Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari warned Israel was on “high alert” for “Iranian aggression.”
    

            European officials warned against further escalation between Israel and Iran.
    

            The United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, wrote on social media platform X that he had spoken with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz.
    

            The two discussed their “shared concerns about Iranian threats to attack Israel,” Cameron wrote, adding that “further escalation in the region is in no-one’s interest and risks further loss of civilian life.”

Powell, Sophie Tanno, Emma Tucker, Kaanita Iyer, Paul LeBlanc and Adrienne Vogt, Jerome Taylor and James Legge, CNNUpdated 12:36 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024What we coveredThe Middle East has been plunged deeper into uncharted waters after Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones from its territory toward Israel in an unprecedented five-hour strike.The vast majority of missiles were intercepted outside Israel's territory by aerial defense systems, its military said. There have been no reports of injuries suffered directly through Iranian strikes, according to Israel’s emergency service. Iran's foreign ministry said the attack was in retaliation to a deadly Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month.President Joe Biden made clear US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, according to a senior administration official. But he said Washington's commitment to Israel’s security against Iranian threats remains ""ironclad."" US forces intercepted more than 70 drones and at least three ballistic missiles, according to US officials. The US assessment is that Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful.Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link104 PostsSort byLatestOldestDropdown arrow12:36 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024Our live coverage of Iran's attack on Israel has moved here.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:31 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024Iran warns its response will be ""stronger and more resolute"" if Israel retaliates following latest strikesFrom CNN’s Alireza Hajihosseini and Eyad KourdiAn anti-missile system operates as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, on Sunday. Amir Cohen/ReutersIran has warned that it will respond with more force if Israel retaliates over this weekend's strikes, which Tehran said were themselves a reply to an Israeli attack earlier this month on its embassy complex in Syria's capital Damascus.“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,"" Iran’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a statement. Should the Israeli regime commit any military aggression again, Iran's response will assuredly and decisively be stronger and more resolute,” Ambassador Iravani added.Citing self-defense against repeated Israeli military aggressions, Iravani said the strikes were specifically in retaliation to an Israeli attack on April 1 against what Iran says were diplomatic facilities in Damascus. Iran claims the attack violated international law and led to the death of seven Iranian military advisors, including key commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The statement also criticizes the United Nations Security Council for “failing to uphold international peace,” allowing Israel to “breach” established international norms and “escalate” regional tensions.Additional context: Israel has carried out numerous strikes on Iran-backed targets in Syria, often targeting weapons shipments allegedly intended for Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian proxy in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the April 1 attack which destroyed an Iranian consulate building in the capital Damascus, including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top Revolutionary Guards commander.However an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN that their intelligence showed the building was not a consulate and was instead “a military building of Quds forces disguised as a civilian building.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:08 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024China expresses 'deep concern', calls for ceasefireFrom CNN's Philip Wang and Irene NasserChina has expressed ""deep concern"" over the ""current escalation"" following Iran's attack on Israel, according to a spokesperson for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, adding that it is a ""spillover of the Gaza conflict"" and a ceasefire should be implemented without delay.In a statement, China called ""on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalations.""""The ongoing situation is the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict,"" the spokesperson said, adding that a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas should be implemented without any more delay.Beijing did not name or condemn Hamas in the wake of the initial October 7 attacks. Since then, it has condemned the war and been a vocal proponent of an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of a “two-state” solution.Last month, Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian met Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar, the first meeting between a Chinese and Hamas official publicly acknowledged by Beijing since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.Wang’s visit follows efforts by Beijing to step up its profile as a peace broker in the Middle East conflict.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:45 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024US forces intercepted 70+ drones and at least three ballistic missiles, US officials sayFrom CNN's Oren Liebermann and Haley BritzkyUS forces intercepted more than 70 one-way attack drones and at least three ballistic missiles during Iran's attack on Israel, according to two US officials familiar with the situation.The ballistic missiles were intercepted by warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the officials said. Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles in total at Israel, according to a senior administration official. The US Navy currently has two destroyers in that area, both are guided missile destroyers capable of intercepting missile and drone launches.US fighter jets were also part of the response to Iran’s attack on Saturday and shot down drones launched towards Israel, another US official told CNN.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:40 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Biden to meet with G7 leaders Sunday as he condemns Iran's ""brazen attack"" From CNN’s Lauren KoenigUS President Joe Biden will meet with G7 leaders Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” according to a statement released by the White House. “My team will engage with their counterparts across the region. And we will stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders,” the statement from Biden reads. “And while we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people.”US defensive assets moved to the region earlier this week and “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” according to the statement.Biden also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu following Saturday’s attack “to reaffirm America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.” I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the president wrote.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:37 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024United Airlines cancels three Middle East flightsFrom CNN’s Sara SmartAt least three United Airlines flights headed to or departing from the Middle East have been canceled amid the ongoing conflict unfolding between Iran and Israel.On Saturday a flight from Newark, New Jersey to Tel Aviv, a flight from Washington D.C. to Amman, Jordan, and one from Dubai to Newark were canceled, the airline told CNN in a statement.We are closely monitoring the situation and will make decisions on upcoming flights with a focus on the safety of our customers and crews,” the airline said.There have been no changes to any Sunday flights for United as of Saturday night, according to the airline. CNN has reached out to other airlines regarding cancellations.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:22 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Biden told Netanyahu US will not participate in offensive operations against Iran, US official saysFrom CNN's MJ LeeA US Marine guards the entrance to the West Wing of the White House on Saturday.

No cruise missile made impact, the official said, and nothing of “value” was hit. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:21 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Bolton: 'Passivity at this point for Israel would be a big mistake'From CNN's Heather ChenJohn Bolton, the former US national security adviser and ambassador to the UN, said “passivity at this point for Israel would be a big mistake,” warning of more attacks. “This is not time to play academic games and message and signal. This is a question of power,” Bolton told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. ""If they came from a different location containing nuclear warheads, Israel might not be so lucky.”A known Iran policy hawk, Bolton served in senior national security positions during the Trump and Bush administrations. A neoconservative, Bolton has in the past advocated war with Iran and a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. In 2022, he was the target of an alleged assassination attempt orchestrated by a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He has warned against underestimating Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran has said is for peaceful purposes only.“I think we have enough experience with faulty intelligence by now, not to be so sure, not to know how much of Iran’s uranium enrichment program is really being conducted under a mountain in North Korea,” Bolton said.If Tehran sent “a wire transfer to Pyongyang,” it would give the North Koreans “enough time to put a couple of warheads on an airplane and fly them to Tehran. (But) if you take away their nuclear capability, that would be a dramatic hit to the regime, maybe enough to topple it.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

Retired general breaks down Israeli defense system

CNN
         — 
    


            Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel on Saturday night, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria, bringing the long-running shadow war between the two sides into the open and raising the prospect of full-blown regional conflict.
    

            More than 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israel in an immense aerial attack overnight, but “99%” of them were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its “partners,” according to the Israeli military.
    

            The reprisals marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil, marking a dangerous new inflection point in the fast widening Middle East conflict. 


            Iran has warned that it will respond with “stronger and more resolute” actions if Israel retaliates over this weekend’s strikes, according to Tehran’s ambassador to the United Nations.
    

            In a phone call with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, US President Joe Biden made clear the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran – as he reaffirmed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel,” a senior White House official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            The US assessed that almost all of the drones and missiles – including more than 100 ballistic missiles – launched by Iran had been knocked out of the sky. No cruise missile made impact and nothing of “value” was hit, according to the administration official.
    

            There have been no reports of injuries suffered directly through Iranian strikes, according to Israel’s emergency service, though it said a 7-year-old girl had been severely injured by shrapnel from Israel’s interceptor missile.
    

            As news of the attack broke, public shelters were opened in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and large public gatherings banned. Israel closed its airspace, as did nearby Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon. By Sunday morning both Israel and Jordan reopened their airspace.
    

            CNN’s team in Jerusalem could hear explosions and sirens as apparent intercepts took place early Sunday morning local time.
    

            “We are continuing to see multiple intercepts in the skies above me coming from multiple different directions. It’s hard to tell what is an incoming missile and what is an intercept,” CNN’s Nic Robertson reported.
    

            “I’m hearing multiple, multiple detonations, again of what sound like interceptions. I am not hearing the sound of impacts,” he said, adding that his team had already witnessed dozens of apparent intercepts.
    

            By early morning Sunday local time, Iran’s mission to the United Nations announced that the attack was now “deemed concluded” – but warned of potential future escalation.
    

            Separately, more than 55 rockets were fired from Lebanon to Israel on early morning Sunday local time, according to the Israeli military.

            The onslaught against Israel prompted Biden to hold a lengthy meeting with his national security team on Saturday night to assess the situation, according to a US official.
    

            Biden will also meet with G7 leaders on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” according to a statement released by the White House.
    

            US defensive assets moved to the region earlier this week and “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” according to the statement.
    

            US forces intercepted more than 70 one-way attack drones and at least 3 ballistic missiles Iran fired toward Israel, according to two US official familiar with the situation.
    

            The ballistic missiles were intercepted by warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the officials said. The US Navy currently has two destroyers in that area, both are guided missile destroyers capable of intercepting missile and drone launches.
    

            US fighter jets were also part of the US’ response to Iran’s attack on Saturday and shot down drones launched towards Israel, another US official told CNN.

    Retaliation for strike on embassy complex


            Fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could spiral into a wider regional conflict have been been rising since Iran accused Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.
    

            Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would be punished for the attack, while President Ebrahim Raisi said it would “not go unanswered,” state news agency IRNA reported. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said the strike would be met with “punishment and revenge.”
    




            Israel has not publicly acknowledged responsibility for the strike but said it believed the building struck was a “military building of Quds forces” — a unit of the IRGC responsible for foreign operations.
    

            Shortly after the launch of the drones on Saturday night, Iran’s Defense Minister, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, warned that any country that allows Israel to use its airspace or territory for attacking Iran would face a “decisive response.”
    

    How the world reacted


            In a statement released on Telegram, Iran’s Foreign Ministry claimed the attack showed Iran’s “responsible approach to regional and international peace and security at a time [of] illegal and genocidal actions by the Zionist apartheid regime against the Palestinian people.”
    

            However, a host of countries from the Middle East to Europe and Latin America voiced concerns over the possibility for escalation, many of them condemning Iran’s actions.
    

            UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying he was “deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation.” Regional powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt voiced similar concerns, with Egypt saying it was in contact with “all concerned parties to try to contain the situation.”
    

            Various European countries condemned the attack and expressed support for Israel, with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, describing it on X as “an unprecedented escalation and a grave threat to regional security.”
    

            The UK and France both reiterated their commitments to Israel’s security, with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying Iran had “once again demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard.”
    

            The Netherlands, Austria and the Czech Republic also condemned the attack and expressed support for Israel, while Spain and Portugal called for de-escalation.
    

            China has also expressed “deep concern” over the escalation, calling on “relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalations.” It called the attack a “spillover of the Gaza conflict” and urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            Over the past months, American officials have urged Beijing to use its leverage over Iran to help prevent a regionwide conflict. China has been Iran’s biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran’s oil exports.


            In Latin America, Chile and Mexico both condemned the use of force, while Argentina’s President Javier Milei cut short a trip to Denmark to fly back to his country and form a crisis committee. His spokesperson Manuel Adorni said the meeting was to “take charge of the situation and coordinate actions with the presidents of the Western world.”

      As Iran attacks Israel, Biden confronts an escalating Middle East crisis he had hoped to avoid

         — 
    


            For President Joe Biden, an attack on Israel launched from Iranian soil amounts to a scenario he’d greatly sought to avoid since the start of the current Middle East conflict.
    

            The reprisals heighten the risk of a wider regional conflict that could directly draw in the United States, along with other countries.
    

            And they place Biden — again — in the tenuous position of pledging stalwart support for Israel while also trying to prevent a new conflagration from exploding with the United States involved.
    

            What comes next is unknown. In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s attacks, American officials acknowledged they were entering uncharted territory.  One significant question mark is how proxies might potentially join Iranian efforts to target Israel and add a new layer of unpredictability. And with Israel’s plans for a response still being formed, Biden administration officials are expected to continue advising their Israeli counterparts – with the desire for containment in mind.
    

            In a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, in which Biden told Netanyahu to consider Saturday a win because the US assessed Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, Biden made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran in response, a senior administration official told CNN.
    

            But in the hours following Iran’s attack, it became clear the president faces a severe challenge putting a lid on the flare-up between Iran and Israel and stopping a full-scale regional war breaking out.
    

            Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, but the scope of that response has yet to be determined, an Israeli official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on Sunday.
    

            The official said Israel is yet to determine whether to try to “break all the dishes” or do something more measured.
    

            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting on Sunday.
    

            The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates saying a “new equation” had been created.
    

            Biden is also operating within the fraught politics of an election year, lending outsized importance to his upcoming decisions. The eruption of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 has hurt Biden at home, eroding his support with key constituencies as he has declined to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            One of the reasons Biden returned urgently to the White House from his beach house in Delaware Saturday afternoon was the ongoing nature of the attack, one official said, with the Situation Room better equipped for real-time monitoring of events.
    

            Administration officials saw Iran’s attacks on Israel Saturday as disproportionate to Israel’s strikes in Damascus that prompted the retaliation, a US official told CNN.
    

            That view has been an important factor in the discussions taking place in the White House throughout the day on next steps, particularly as Biden is set on preventing a full-scale regional conflict from erupting.
    

            There is also a recognition that what Israel is likely to do in response will depend on a full damage assessment, including potential casualties, so the Biden administration’s advice to Israel will depend on that picture coming into focus, the official added.
    

            In the immediate aftermath of the Israeli strikes in Syria that killed top Iranian commanders, US officials monitored Iran gearing up to launch a major attack on Israel, seeing it as inevitable. As the US, in close consultation with Israel, sought to figure out exactly how, when and where exactly Iran would retaliate, administration officials never fully ruled out Iran trying to strike inside Israel as well as American personnel and assets in the region.
    

            The most likely “worst case scenario,” one senior administration official said in the days leading up to Iran’s Saturday attacks, was a direct attack by Iran on Israel, and the eruption of a state-on-state conflict that could very well prompt the beginning of a wider regional conflict that the US has been working to prevent since the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attacks.
    

            Despite his current tensions with Netanyahu over the war in Gaza, Biden and his top officials have sought over the past week to diminish any daylight between the US and Israel when it comes to Israel’s defense against Iran.
    

            In the hours before Iran launched its attack, the US defense secretary and national security adviser spoke with their counterparts in Israel to reiterate that support. And last week, Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, was in Israel discussing contingencies with officials ahead of the expected attack.
    

            Biden kept to his Friday promise that “the US is devoted to the defense of Israel,” with defense officials telling CNN that the US military successfully intercepted some Iranian missiles on Saturday.
    

            Contained within the conversations about preparations for Iran’s attack and coordinating a response were also implicit encouragement to the Israeli government to not allow the situation to spiral out of control if Iran’s response was limited in nature, officials familiar with the matter said.
    

            The US also sent messages publicly and privately to Iran warning about escalating the crisis further and pressed European and Arab allies to use their own leverage with Tehran to deliver similar messages.
    

            As Iran’s plans to attack Israel grew clearer, American officials increasingly assessed that Tehran was not seeking direct conflict with the United States. Ahead of the drone attack launched by Iran on Saturday, US officials said they did not expect the targets to include American forces in the region.
    

            That is a change from earlier in the conflict, when Iran-backed militias regularly attacked US troops in the Middle East, including in a strike that killed three Americans stationed in Jordan. After the US launched retaliatory strikes, the attacks by Iranian proxies waned.
    

            Yet the simmering tensions between Iran and Israel have not let up. Without any direct channels of communication between the two countries, the risk of miscalculation is amplified.

            Almost all the ballistic missiles and drones Iran launched at Israel in an unprecedented attack late Saturday were intercepted and failed to meet their mark, according to Israeli and American officials, highlighting the formidable, and multi-layered missile defense deployed by the two allied partners.
    

            Most of the more than 300 Iranian munitions, the majority of which are believed to have been launched from inside of Iran’s territory during a five-hour attack, were intercepted before they got to Israel, more than 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from their launch points.
    

            Israel’s military said Sunday that “99%” of projectiles fired by Iran were intercepted by Israel and its partners, with only “a small number” of ballistic missiles reaching Israel.
    

            In total, around 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles were launched at Israel by Iran overnight Saturday, the military said.
    

            In a call Sunday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that constituted a win for Israel as nothing of “value” was hit, a senior US administration official told CNN.
    

            US officials said more than 70 drones and three ballistic missiles were intercepted by US Navy ships and military aircraft, without giving details of exactly what defenses were used to bring down the projectiles.

'Massive failure of Israeli and American deterrence': John Bolton on Iranian strikes

            The US Navy shot down at least three ballistic missiles using the Aegis missile defense system aboard two guided-missiles destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, officials told CNN’s Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon.
    

            US warplanes also shot down Iranian ordnance, Liebermann reported. While it was not revealed from where those US jets operated, there are US Navy aircraft carriers and land-based aircraft well within range of the region.
    

            Biden said in a statement the US was well-prepared to help defend Israel against the Iranian attack.
    

            “To support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,” the US president said in a statement.
    

            “Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said.
    

            Britain said it was also prepared to intervene using Royal Air Force aircraft it has in the region.
    

            “These UK jets will intercept any airborne attacks within range of our existing missions, as required,” a Defense Ministry statement said.
    

            An Israeli military spokesperson also said France was involved in blocking the Iranian attacks.
    

            “We are working closely with the US, UK and France who acted tonight. This partnership has always been close, but tonight it manifested itself in an unusual way,” the spokesperson said.

Retired general predicts more attacks following drone strikes launched by Iran

            Meanwhile, Israel operates a range of systems to block attacks from everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.
    

            Israel’s Iron Dome system has been in the headlines often since the country began its military offensive in Gaza in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks inside Israel that sparked the current hostilities in the region.
    

            The Iron Dome is the bottom layer of Israel’s missile defense, according to the country’s Missile Defense Organization (IMDO).
    

            There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries in Israel, each equipped with a radar that detects rockets and then uses a command-and-control system that quickly calculates whether an incoming projectile poses a threat or is likely to hit an unpopulated area. If the rocket does pose a threat, the Iron Dome fires missiles from the ground to destroy it in the air.

            The next rung up the missile defense ladder is David’s Sling, which protects against short- and medium-range threats, according to the IMDO.
    

            David’s Sling, a joint project of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon, uses Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to take out targets as far as 186 miles away, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS).
    

            Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States.
    

            The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the Arrow 2 an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.
    

            Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.
    

            Israel also has state-of-the-art fighter aircraft, including F-35I stealth jets that it has used to shoot down drones and cruise missiles before, according to news reports.
    

            The ballistic missiles that did reach Israel fell on the Netavim Air Base in southern Israel, Israel’s military spokesman said, adding that they caused only light structural damage. The base was functioning and continuing its operations following the attack, with planes continuing to use the base, he added.
    

            Photos released by the Israeli Air Force early Sunday showed F-35 and F-15 fighter jets returning to their bases in Israel after what were called successful “interceptions” and “aerial defense missions.”
    

            Some of the weapons launched at Israel were fired from Iraq and Yemen, the spokesman added.

      Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

Beirut, Lebanon
CNN
         — 
    


            A decades-long shadow war burst out into the open overnight as Iranian drones and missiles lit up the night sky in Israel and the occupied West Bank. Tehran’s operation was highly choreographed, apparently designed to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle.
    

            This was a complex mission. Over 300 drones and missiles navigated above Iran’s neighbors, including Jordan and Iraq — both with US military bases — before penetrating the airspace of Iran’s mortal enemy, Israel. Israel’s allies helped shoot down the bulk of these weapons, but couldn’t prevent what was long believed to be the Middle East’s doomsday scenario, the Islamic Republic’s first-ever attack on Israel.
    

            Israel’s fabled Iron Dome air defense system did not disappoint Israelis, many of whom took to bunkers. Only a small handful of locations were attacked, including a military base and an area in the Negev desert, injuring a Bedouin child, while the dome fended off one of the largest drone attacks in history
    

            Yet it was an operation that seemed designed to fail — when Iran launched its killer drones from its own territory some 1,000 miles away, it was giving Israel hours of advance notice.
    

            The symbolism of the attack did the heavy lifting. Rather than fire from one of the neighboring countries where Iran and its non-state allies are present, this was a direct attack from Iranian territory on Israeli territory. This compromised Iran’s ability to damage Israel because it robbed the operation of the element of surprise.
    

            Yet for some four hours, the world held its breath as weapons whizzed through the night sky. They were balls of fire hovering overhead as onlookers across three different countries filmed images that seemed to harken the start of a cataclysmic war.

            The lead time meant that Israel and its regional partners could ready Israel’s defenses, and the operation amounted to little more than a terrifying fireworks display. When Iran’s permanent mission at the United Nations tweeted that the operation had “concluded,” it was easy to come away from it thinking the Islamic Republic was all bark and no bite.
    

            The strike served as a retaliation against the Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s consulate in Damascus earlier in April that killed a top commander, and it was in keeping with US intelligence and analysts’ expectations. Iran’s leadership felt compelled to strike Israel in order to reiterate its position as a regional powerhouse and to dispel notions of it as a paper tiger. It doubled down on its show of force by launching the operation from its own territory and not by proxy in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq.
    

            Yet Iran also needed to try to avoid sparking an all-out war. Its economy has buckled under the weight of Trump-era sanctions, and there is growing discontent on its streets over the government’s repressive policies. On Sunday, Iran appeared not only to have factored in Israel’s robust air defense systems, but to have relied on it. The relatively high degree of US intelligence about the operation also suggests Iran may have engaged in back-channelling with Western leaders. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said he gave neighboring countries, including major US allies, 72-hour notice. To contain the fall-out of their own operation, they appeared intent to foil it.
    

            The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.
    

            At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.
    

            Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.

            In a future Iran strike, Tehran may not hesitate to use Israel’s northern border as a launching pad. A week before the attack, one Lebanese source familiar with the matter had ruled out that Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful armed group partner, would be part of Iran’s initial retaliation to the April 1 consulate strike.
    

            However, the source warned that Hezbollah and other Iran-backed fighting forces “will be prepared for the stage that comes after the Iranian response.”
    

            A forceful Israeli retaliation may push Iran to take on an even more hardline position beyond its Israel policy. Conservatives have consolidated control of Iran’s government in recent years, and there is growing resistance to Western pressure to curb the country’s feared uranium enrichment program.
    

            “There must be some satisfaction in certain circles in DC and Israel that Iran’s limited response reflects the imbalance of power in Israel’s favor,” wrote Trita Parsi, DC-based Iran analyst and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute, on X.
    

            “But think further and you’ll realise how this episode will strengthen those in Tehran who believe Iran must go nuclear.”

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

CNN
         — 
    


            President Joe Biden and senior members of his national security team, seeking to contain the risk of a wider regional war following a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones directed toward Israel, have told their counterparts the US will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, according to US officials familiar with the matter.
    

            In a conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday, Biden sought to frame Israel’s successful interception of the Iranian onslaught as a major victory — with the suggestion that further Israeli response was unnecessary.
    

            Biden told the Israeli prime minister in his phone call that he should consider Saturday a win because Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, a senior administration official said. The US assessed that there was “no significant damage within Israel itself,” according to a senior US military official.
    

            John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Sunday the ability to prevent widespread damage was a demonstration of Israel’s “military superiority” and proof that Iran was not the “military power that they claim to be.”

Kirby: Israel’s response to Iran’s attack ‘was an incredible success’




            “This was an incredible success, really proving Israel’s military superiority and just as critically, their diplomatic superiority, that they have friends in the region, that they have around the world that are willing to help them,” Kirby told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    

            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asked his Israeli counterpart, Minister Yoav Gallant, to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to another US official.
    

            Even as American officials stressed to their counterparts that the final decision on how to respond to Iran is up to Israel, Biden has sought to prevent a wider escalation of the conflict.
    

            On Sunday, Biden met with his fellow Group of Seven leaders to discuss a “united diplomatic response” — with the emphasis on non-military actions that would limit the prospects of a wider war.
    

            In a joint statement released after the virtual meeting, the G7 members condemned “in the strongest terms” Iran’s “direct and unprecedented attack” against Israel and expressed their “full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our commitment towards its security.”
    

            “With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 statement said.
    

            A senior administration official later described the convening of leaders and their discussion about Iran as “constructive” and stressed ongoing support for Israel.
    

            “We are committed to defending Israel. We would not be a part of any of any response they do. That’s very consistent policy,” the senior administration official said.

            Whether Netanyahu takes Biden’s advice remains an open question. The Iranian reprisals came at a moment of deep tension between the men over the war in Gaza. Throughout that conflict, the limits of American influence on Israeli decision-making have been laid bare.
    

            Israel told the United States that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” the senior Biden administration said Sunday.
    

            “The president was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel, and he made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” the senior administration official said.
    

            Iran’s decision to fire weapons from its own territory toward Israel significantly ratchets up the long-simmering enmity between the two countries. There will likely be political pressure from inside Israel for some type of response.
    

            Kirby said the attack — the first launched from Iranian soil against Israel — did not necessarily have to constitute the start of a broader regional war.
    

            “We don’t believe it is nor do we believe it has to be,” he told Tapper, noting that the US and Israel both had a good sense of what Iran was planning to do ahead of time.
    

            Gallant warned Sunday that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting.
    

            The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates, saying a “new equation” had been created.
    

    Tense moments in the Situation Room


            Biden gathered Saturday with his national security team for “real-time updates” on Iran’s attack against Israel – at times leading to “tense moments” in the White House Situation Room.
    

            One of those tense moments occurred when over 100 ballistic missiles were in the sky, with a short travel time to Israel.
    

            “The results of the defenses, of course, were unclear until all was said and done. As the results of the defenses came in, which is when we knew that preparations and planning had succeeded, there was a bit of a relief,” the senior administration official said.
    

            US officials have touted ongoing preparations ahead of Iran’s attack, which had been anticipated since a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

            Preparations ahead of Saturday’s attack started “nearly two weeks ago,” the senior administration official said, and involved a force posture adjustment, and ongoing discussions with Israelis and other partners in the region, among other measures.
    

            After the White House determined Saturday’s attack was largely defeated, Biden connected with Netanyahu.
    

            Biden has continued to be routinely updated, according to officials. On Sunday morning, the president again gathered his advisers in the Situation Room, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and Mideast coordinator Brett McGurk.

         — 
    


            Thousands of Palestinians, including men, women, children and elderly, attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday when they came under Israeli fire.
    

            Video filmed by a CNN stringer shows the once-perilous coastal road of Al Rasheed filled with families walking with their belongings, some riding bicycles, donkey carts and pick-up trucks, smiling and snapping photographs.
    

            “I’m going to Gaza City. It’s enough. We need to go back to our homes and lands. We are tired of displacement… we heard people saying we can go back, but no one official told us. We’ll leave it to God,” Majd El-Aqqad said.

            Videos began circulating online Sunday morning showing people heading to the north for the first time in such large numbers. Some people told CNN they heard the Israeli military was allowing women and children to move back up. Others said their relatives were allowed to cross over.
    

            In response to a question from CNN, the IDF said the reports were false.
    

            “The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted,” IDF said.
    

            In the video shot for CNN, an elderly woman named Um Mohammad walks along the road carrying a heavy bag on her head and two others in her arms, attempting to reach her home.
    

            She cries and prays for God to protect them.
    

            “I don’t know anything about my house. It’s our home and our land. The Israelis displaced us and humiliated us,” she said.
    

            “We are tired here. We have been displaced for 191 days,” Malak Abu Nada, a woman from Jabalya, told CNN.
    






Majd El-Aqqad said she is returning to Gaza City. ""We need to go back to our homes and lands. We are tired of displacement,"" she said.

            Many of the people who attempted to head north had been displaced to Rafah, where Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been threatening to launch an offensive that the UN said would lead to a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
    

            The Gaza Ministry of Health reported on Sunday that the toll in the Gaza Strip since October 7 has risen to 33,729 dead and 76,371 people injured.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.
    

            A young boy named Omar Al-Dahdouh carried a bag of flour on his shoulder, holding his younger sibling’s hand and sobbing as he walked.
    

            “I am going home. I have been displaced for six months. We live in a tent because our house was struck,” he said.
    

            “I am not afraid. If I must die, I will die, but I don’t want to live this anymore. I want to go home, I’m tired. My siblings need to live,” he continued.
    

            Ahmad Ramadan told CNN he had tried to cross to the north but was turned back by Israeli soldiers because he was a man.
    

            “We heard the road was open to Gaza City, so we thought we’d go. When they saw men with us, they started shooting at us. We are tired and humiliated,” Um Awni Al-Jarousha told CNN.
    

            Footage shows people turning around, heading back south with the sound of drones and planes buzzing overhead. Missiles can be seen in the distance while people run in panic.
    

            “We reached all the way to the checkpoint until we saw Israeli tanks. We headed back because they fired towards us. We didn’t see anyone make it to the other side. We risked our children’s lives to cross, but apparently it was all a lie,” one woman said.

            Video shows several people with what appear to be gunshot wounds. One man is seen carrying another man who has blood streaming along his face from a head injury.
    

            Another man is seen carrying a 5-year-old girl named Sally Abu Laila, who is bleeding from her head and surrounded by people trying to help.
    

            Her mother Sabreen told CNN her daughter was in her arms when Israeli soldiers shot at her. They had attempted to cross into the north with Sabreen’s husband, but the soldiers turned him back, leaving her and her four children to face the journey alone.
    

            The moment she tried to pass through, two young men squeezed in between her and other women waiting in line at the checkpoint. That’s when Israeli soldiers fired at them, she said.
    

            Chaos then ensued, with Sabreen describing people trampling over each other as they tried to escape the gunshots.

            “I tried to put my daughter on the ground to walk, but she couldn’t move. I saw my hands covered in blood. I called on her, ‘Sally! Sally! Sally!’, but she didn’t answer… I didn’t know my daughter was injured… she is my only girl, and my heart broke,” Sabreen told CNN.
    

            Eventually, she said, she managed to get to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, where her daughter is undergoing treatment. She told CNN she is still in intensive care.
    

            Graphic footage shot for CNN shows Sally crying out in pain, blood on her body with a wound on her head and arm as she gets treated by two doctors.
    

            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on reports that its soldiers fired shots at civilians trying to head up north, but has not received a response.

      Opinion: What does Iran really want?

CNN
         — 
    


            On the surface, Iran’s Saturday missile and drone attack on Israel was a response to the Israelis’ airstrike on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus two weeks ago that killed at least seven officials, including commanders of the nation’s Revolutionary Guards.
    

            Yet it also was an outgrowth of the enmity between Iran and Israel, including its ally the United States, that has been building for decades, a result of both the Iranian regime’s nature and of policy reversals and blunders by the US ever since the Western- and Israel-allied Shah of Iran was overthrown by Islamists in the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
    

            “A modern, strong, peaceful Iran could become a pillar of stability and progress in the region,” former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in 2006. “This cannot happen unless Iran’s leaders decide whether they are representing a cause or a nation – whether their basic motivation is crusading or international cooperation.”
    

            Like other regimes driven by a revolutionary ideology, Iran’s ayatollahs chose to be a cause, exporting their influence and ideas to other countries and to an array of militant groups.
    

            The goals of the ayatollahs are threefold: to evict the United States from the Middle East, to replace Israel with Palestine and to bring down the US-led world order, according to Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour, whom I recently interviewed for the Audible podcast “In the Room with Peter Bergen.” These are not modest goals, but Sadjadpour said you can’t underestimate the revolutionary fervor of Iran’s leaders.

Israel weighs response after Iran fires missile barrage




            The Iranian campaign to evict the United States from the Middle East began in Lebanon in the early 1980s, when Iran backed a ragtag bunch of militants living in the Shia-dominated areas of southern Beirut who had founded Hezbollah, “the party of God.”
    

            Using the then-novel technique of suicide bombings, they bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including eight CIA officers, the deadliest day in CIA history. Hezbollah also bombed the Marine barracks building in Beirut, killing 241 American service members.
    

            Those attacks by Hezbollah achieved their aim. The Reagan administration pulled all US forces out of Lebanon. A wealthy young Saudi fundamentalist named Osama bin Laden was watching closely: He concluded that if you applied enough military pressure on the Americans, they would pull out of the Middle East.
    

            After bin Laden’s al Qaeda attacked the US on September 11, 2001, the Americans effectively handed the Iranians a big gift, which was the 2003 overthrow of their mortal enemy, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, against whom Iran had fought a ruinous, almost-decade-long war during the 1980s.
    

Following the fall of Saddam, Iraq was wracked by a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands. Iran introduced into the Iraqi war zone highly effective roadside bombs known as EFPs – Explosively Formed Penetrators – that wounded and killed hundreds of American soldiers. In 2011, the US withdrew from Iraq.
    

            The official US Army history of the Iraq War concluded that Iran was the only winner of that war. This wasn’t the conclusion of vocal war critic Noam Chomsky but of a group of sober US Army historians.
    

    Iran’s ‘cookie-cutter approach’


            Norman Roule was the top US intelligence official on Iran from 2008 to 2017. Roule observed to me for the “In the Room” podcast that “Iran uses a cookie-cutter approach across the region, but the dough in each country is different, and the cooking time is different.”
    

            In Syria, a civil war began in 2011, and Iran saw another opportunity for this cookie-cutter approach by propping up the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad with billions of dollars of aid as well as Iranian advisers and Hezbollah forces on the ground fighting for the Assad regime.
    

            That explains the continued presence in Damascus today of senior Iranian military leaders and advisers like the ones who were killed by the Israeli airstrike on April 1 that precipitated Iran’s missile and drone barrage against Israel on Saturday.
    

            In Yemen, the Houthis started fighting the central government, and – particularly after Iran’s rival for regional dominance, the Saudis, intervened in the Yemeni war in 2015 – Iran trained the Houthis and supplied them with missiles and drones. These are the same weapons that the Houthis have been using against ships in the Red Sea, effectively closing the shipping route to and from the Suez Canal and cutting off a critical route for global trade.

            And then there is Hamas. While Iran had no foreknowledge of Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, according to Christine Abizaid, the director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, Iran has supplied Hamas with hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons and training, according to the US Treasury Department.
    

            Iran’s proxies in the Middle East, to one degree or another, now exert significant influence on Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. These proxies are grandiloquently known as “the axis of resistance” to Israel and the United States, and they exert their influence on a region that extends 1,500 miles from the north in Lebanon to Yemen’s Red Sea coast in the south. And now the Iranians are closer than ever to having nuclear weapons.
    

            The most significant foreign policy blunder of the Trump administration was pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal inked by the Obama administration, which was preventing the Iranians from enriching uranium above around 4%; you need around 90% enrichment of uranium for a nuclear device. Before former President Donald Trump reneged on the deal, Iran was observing the terms of the nuclear agreement, according to Trump’s own intelligence chiefs. Today, the Iranians reportedly have enough highly enriched uranium for three weapons and are considered closer than ever to having a workable nuclear weapon.
    

    ‘Deemed concluded’?


            Saturday’s drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can’t be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, according to the Israeli military. It’s likely that Iran’s theocratic regime, which has faced major internal protests and is approaching a generational transition, wanted to respond to calls for retribution for the Damascus attack without triggering a major war with two superior militaries – that of the US and Israel.
    

            The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York released a statement as Iran’s attacks were in progress, saying they had now responded to the strike against “our diplomatic premises in Damascus” and “the matter can be deemed concluded.”
    









President Joe Biden speaks to the National Action Network Convention remotely from the South Court Auditorium of the White House, Friday, April 12, 2024, in Washington. President Biden's re-election campaign is wrangling with the Republican-dominated states of Ohio and Alabama to assure he's listed on their November ballots, amid hints that a routine procedural negotiation is becoming politically charged.

            That, of course, doesn’t mean that Israel will deem the matter concluded. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hasn’t achieved his strategic objectives in Gaza of wiping out Hamas militarily and returning the 100 or so hostages held by Hamas, and is also not well-liked by most Israelis, can surely benefit from a rally-around-the-flag effect by casting himself as an assertive wartime leader. Of course, the Israeli public may also demand action to restore deterrence against Iran, having just lived through a barrage of Iranian missile and drone strikes.
    

            So, despite President Joe Biden calling Netanyahu on Saturday night to tell him that Iran’s attack hadn’t succeeded and saying the US wouldn’t support any counterattack, it would hardly be in character for Netanyahu not to respond in some fashion against Iran.
    

            And here is where things might get even worse as the burgeoning regional conflict that the Biden administration has long tried to avoid is now in higher gear, and it’s unclear where everyone’s red lines are and what might trigger a major war with Iran.
    

            As Abizaid noted in an interview for my podcast before Saturday’s attack by Iran, the issue is that “everyone has sort of a loose understanding of what these red lines might be, and events could change your perception of whether one of those has been crossed at any given time.”
    

    The Iraq factor


            On Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani will meet with Biden at the White House. The meeting comes at a time when there is considerable pressure in Iraq to withdraw the 2,500 US troops who remain there on an anti-ISIS mission.
    

            The withdrawal of the US troops from neighboring Iraq is a key goal of Iran, which exerts considerable influence over some Iraqi politicians.

            This poses a dilemma for both the Iraqi government and the Biden administration since the US troops based in Iraq have been frequent targets of Iranian-backed militias since the Gaza war started. While these attacks stopped following the killing of three US soldiers by an Iranian-backed militia in Jordan in January, if conflict were to start heating up with Iran, those attacks against US bases in Iraq could resume.
    

            Balanced against that is that the last time the US pulled all its forces out of Iraq was in 2011, and within three years, ISIS had taken over much of the country, a history that the vast majority of Iraqis do not want to repeat.
    

            It will be interesting to see whether, given the increasingly bellicose stance of the Iranians, the Biden administration puts considerable pressure on the Iraqi prime minister to keep those US soldiers on the ground in Iraq.

      Congressional leaders at odds over Israel aid next steps as conservatives warn Johnson against including Ukraine funding

         — 
    


            Congressional leaders from both parties were quick to condemn Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel this Saturday but still remain at odds on how to pass additional Israel funding in wake of the attacks.
    

            House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he will move forward with a vote on additional Israel aid but did not go into specifics about his plans as he walks a knife’s edge with conservatives over the potential inclusion of Ukraine funding.
    

            “The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues,” Johnson told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    

            But hardline conservatives are warning Johnson against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package, underscoring the competing pressures on the speaker as he weighs critical decisions about the path ahead following Iran’s attack on Israel.
    

            “Congress should be clear: no action by Iran or Israel merits a vote on the Ukraine omnibus the Senate seeks,” GOP Rep. Warren Davidson wrote on social media.
    

            The pressure campaign from Johnson’s right flank comes amid bipartisan calls — including from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell — to take up the Senate-passed foreign package that includes money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, arguing that is the fastest way to get aid to Israel.
    

            Johnson has vowed to put some sort of Israel aid bill on the floor this week, but said the details are still being finalized. The House GOP Conference will meet Monday evening to discuss the Iran-Israel situation and their legislative plans going forward, according to GOP sources.
    

            It all amounts to a complicated calculation for Johnson. The House previously struggled to pass a standalone Israel aid bill, but Johnson could draw ire from the right if he ties it to Ukraine or puts the Senate bill on the floor.
    

            The speaker has, however, been trying to get former President Donald Trump’s crucial buy-in for a more GOP-friendly Ukraine aid package, such as structuring the aid as a loan — which Trump signaled openness to during a press conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago.
    

            President Joe Biden participated in a call with congressional leadership on Sunday afternoon to discuss the “urgent need” for the House to pass the bipartisan Senate-passed aid package.
    

            “The President discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible,” the White House said Sunday.
    

            McConnell, Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all participated in the call, according to the White House.
    

            At a news conference Sunday, Schumer urged the GOP-led House to move on the Senate-passed aid package in the wake of the Iranian attack. “The best way to help Israel and to help Ukraine is to pass the supplemental this week,” Schumer said, according to a transcript provided by his office. “I’ve called on Speaker Johnson to do that.”
    

            The House has thus far declined to take a vote on the Senate-passed legislation, with many House conservatives opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine and wanting stricter US southern border policies included in any aid package. But it’s unclear how the Democrat-controlled Senate would approach whatever legislation comes from the GOP-led House.
    

            Individual members have also weighed in on the conflict since the Iranian attacks on Israel, with Democrats imploring Johnson to bring up the Senate foreign aid package as many Republicans call on Schumer to act on Israel only.
    

            Responding to calls from McConnell for the House to bring to the floor the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that passed the Senate in February, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sidestepped, insisting on Sunday that the Senate could pass standalone aid to Israel and win House approval.
    

            “We could go on Monday to Washington, DC, and we can pass aid to Israel right away,” Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding: “If the Senate were to send the House an Israel aid bill on Monday, the House will pass it.”
    

            Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, highlighting the time-sensitive nature of the issue, called on Johnson to bring the supplemental foreign aid package passed by the Senate in February to the floor on Monday.
    

            “I think the most important deterrent action that Congress can take … is for Speaker Johnson to not take days or weeks to try and come up with some other package but to pass the supplemental tomorrow,” Coons told Tapper in a separate interview.
    

    How Congress reached this point


            While the Senate passed its foreign aid bill in February, Johnson said he never planned to bring the bill to the floor. The House, in turn, tried but failed to pass a standalone package for $17.6 billion in Israel aid amid opposition from both Republicans and Democratic leaders.
    

            Because of resistance among members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Johnson had been forced to bring up the bill under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority of the House to approve it. That means he needed the support of a sizable number of Democrats to get behind it, and failed to cross that threshold. At a closed caucus meeting prior to the vote, House Democratic leadership made a forceful case against supporting the standalone Israel aid package to members.
    

            However, given the attacks by Iran and its proxies, leadership in both chambers are under increased pressure to reach a consensus.

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

CNN
         — 
    


            Israel pledged that it will “exact a price” from Iran as the country weighs its response to an unprecedented overnight barrage of drone and missile strikes while facing international pressure to de-escalate.
    

            The overnight attack – which saw Tehran launch a series of strikes at Israel over a five-hour period – threatens to tip the crisis in the Middle East into an untempered regional war.
    

            Israel’s war cabinet has been authorized to respond to the attack and met on Sunday, with one of its members, Benny Gantz, saying the “event is not over.”
    

            He cited the need to “build a regional coalition and exact a price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.”
    

            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier said Israel had “thwarted this attack in a way that is unparalleled” but added “we must be prepared for every scenario.” In his first comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “we have intercepted, we have contained. Together we shall win.”
    

            An Israeli official separately told CNN that Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, but the scope of that attack has yet to be decided. The official said Israel is yet to determine whether to try and “break all the dishes” or do something more measured.
    

            But Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate an intensely fraught situation on Sunday and close, at least for now, a weeks-long chapter of uncertainty and confrontation that had spiraled out of Israel’s war with Hamas that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza and caused a humanitarian disaster in the enclave.

How Israel and allied defenses intercepted more than 300 Iranian missiles and drones




            Iran’s retaliatory attack had been anticipated since a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month, and finally came late on Saturday when over 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israeli soil. Approximately 350 rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Israeli authorities said “99%” of the projectiles were intercepted with help from allies including the US, the UK and France. The only injury reported was a 7-year-old girl who was seriously wounded by shrapnel.
    

            The reprisals brought years of clandestine conflict between the countries into the open, and marked the first time the Islamic Republic had launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.
    

            Israel and Iran have long been rivals, but tensions escalated in the wake of Hamas’ attacks on Israel, which left about 1,200 people dead. Iran backs a web of proxies across the Middle East that have frequently clashed with Israel since the attacks.
    

            The war cabinet meeting lasted for hours and ended Sunday night without a decision on how Israel will respond, according to an Israeli official.
    

            The war cabinet is determined to respond but has yet to decide on the timing and scope, the official said. One of the key dilemmas facing the cabinet is determining how quickly Israel should respond. The official said the Israeli military has been tasked with coming up with additional options for a response.
    

    Iran says next attack could be ‘much bigger’


            On Sunday, Iran said a “new equation” in its adversarial relationship with Israel had been opened, and warned of a “much bigger” assault on the country should Netanyahu decide on a tit-for-tat attack.
    

            “We have decided to create a new equation, which is that if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, anywhere, and at any point we will retaliate against them,” the Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Hossein Salami told Iranian state TV. The “Zionist regime” is a term Iran uses to refer to Israel.
    

            Earlier, Sardar Bagheri, the Chief of Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, had said: “If the Zionist regime responds, our next operation will be much bigger.”
    

            Iran’s attacks targeted the Israeli airbase from which, it said, the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was launched. Iranian ballistic missiles that reached Israel fell on the airbase in southern Israel, and caused only light structural damage, Hagari said.
    

            Bagheri said that from Iran’s perspective, the military operation against Israel “has concluded.” But he emphasized that Iranian armed forces remain on high alert and are prepared to “act if necessary,” according to an interview on state IRINN TV on Sunday.
    

            Those warnings came as Western nations urged Israel to descend from the brink of open warfare with its foe.
    

            After the attack, US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            Israel has told the US that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” a senior Biden administration told reporters Sunday.
    

            “They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.
    

            “The president was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel, and he made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” the official added.

            Biden has meanwhile reiterated that the US’s commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies remains “ironclad.”
    

            Showing some of the domestic pressure Netanyahu faces, two hardline government ministers called for a firm response. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for a retaliation that “resonates throughout the Middle East,” while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Israel should “go crazy.”
    

            Calls for restraint have also been made across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, a major regional rival to Iran, stressed the importance of “preventing any further exacerbation” of the crisis, while Qatar, which enjoys close economic relations with Iran, expressed “profound concern.” The United Arab Emirates warned of “new levels of instability” if the episode was not closed.
    

            Iran had vowed to retaliate after accusing Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

CNN
         — 
    


            The wave of drones and missiles that flew towards Israel overnight on Sunday brought with it a new phase of tension, uncertainty and confrontation in the Middle East.
    

            Iran launched the unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month.
    

            It marked a new chapter in a discord between the two states that percolated for years and has spiralled since Israel declared war on Hamas last October.
    

            The next steps remain unclear, but Israel is facing pleas from its allies to step back from the brink of open warfare and choose a path of de-escalation.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

    How did Iran attack Israel?


            More than 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israel in the immense aerial attack overnight. Approximately 350 rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari.
    

            However, “99%” of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its allies, according to the Israeli military, with only a small number reaching Israeli territory.
    

            Tehran’s attack targeted the Nevatim airbase, an Iranian army official said on Sunday, alleging that this is where Israel’s early April strike on the Iranian consulate was launched from.
    




            Iranian ballistic missiles that reached Israel fell on the airbase in the south of the country and caused only light structural damage, Hagari said. The base is functioning and continuing its operations following the attack, with planes continuing to use the base, Hagari added.
    

            A senior US military official told reporters Sunday that the US assessed “there’s no significant damage within Israel itself.”
    

            US ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea destroyed between four and six Iranian ballistic missiles during the attack and aircraft in the region shot down more than 70 Iranian one-way UAVs headed toward Israel. The US Army Patriot missile battery shot down one ballistic missile in the vicinity of Erbil, Iraq, the official said.
    

    Why did the attack take place?


            Israel and Iran are long-standing rivals and have been engaged in a shadow war for years.
    

            Israel’s war on Hamas, waged since the militant group attacked Israel on October 7, has heightened those tensions.
    

            Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria have launched attacks aimed at US military positions in those countries and Iran’s leadership has warned that attacks by its allies won’t stop until Israel’s war in Gaza ends.
    

            But fears of a spiralling regional war spiked further in early April, when Iran accused Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria.
    




That airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.
    

            Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would be punished for the attack, while President Ebrahim Raisi said it would “not go unanswered,” state news agency IRNA reported. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said the strike would be met with “punishment and revenge.”
    

            The region has been on edge ever since, with the US and Israel warning of intelligence that an Iranian attack was imminent.
    

    How have Israel and its allies responded to the Iranian strike?


            Israel reacted angrily to the unprecedented strikes, while praising its military’s response.
    

            But Israel’s allies in the West urged the country to work to de-escalate the crisis, rather than respond in a way which could tip the situation into open warfare.
    

            US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            After a virtual meeting Sunday, leaders of the G7 condemned in a joint statement the Iranian attack, which it said “risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation.”
    

            “We demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives,” they said.

    What happens next?


            The decisions made by Israel’s War Cabinet will dictate the immediate next steps.
    

            The three-man group met Sunday and then again on Monday, and the attacks sparked a heated debate over how to respond, two Israeli sources told CNN.
    

            The war cabinet remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convened Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, Israeli officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.
    

            One of the members, Benny Gantz said Israel will “exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits us.”
    

            Israeli government hardliners have called for firm action. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged a response that “resonates throughout the Middle East,” and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Israel should “go crazy.”
    

            Israel told the United States that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” a senior Biden administration told reporters Sunday.
    

            “They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.
    

            On Sunday, Iran said a “new equation” in its adversarial relationship with Israel had been opened, and warned of a “much bigger” assault on the country should Netanyahu decide on a tit-for-tat attack.
    

            “We have decided to create a new equation, which is that if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, anywhere, and at any point, we will retaliate against them,” the Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Hossein Salami told Iranian state TV. The “Zionist regime” is a term Iran uses to refer to Israel.

Erdan accused Iran of seeking world domination and that its attack proved that Tehran ""cares nothing, nothing for Islam or Muslims"" before pulling out a tablet to show a video of Israel intercepting Iranian drones above Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque.Erdan called on the UN Security Council to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terror organization. “Action must be taken now, not for Israel's sake, not for the region's sake, but for the world's sake.

Here's the latestFrom CNN staff The hours-long Israeli war cabinet meeting ended Sunday night without a decision on how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile and drone attack, an Israeli official said. The cabinet is determined to respond — but has yet to decide on the timing and scope and the official said the military has been tasked with coming up with additional options for a response.Separately, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that an Israeli official told the United States that it's not looking to significantly escalate the showdown with Iran.CNN analyst Barak Ravid said Israeli ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot advocated for swift action, but US President Joe Biden's phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led to a decision to delay the response until the next day. Here are the latest headlines: Retaliation is over, Iran told US: Iran privately messaged the United States that its retaliation against Israel had concluded, echoing what Tehran said publicly, according to a senior administration official. Late Saturday, Iran said its attack on Israel is a response to Israel's strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and ""the matter can be deemed concluded."" However, President Ebrahim Raisi said any “new aggression against the interests of the Iranian nation will be met with a heavier and regrettable response,” according to Iran’s state news channel IRIB. United Nations response: UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a de-escalation of violence after Iran’s attack. Guterres said the United Nations and member countries have a “shared responsibility” to engage “all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.” He also called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. “Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” he said.G7 and others: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in response to Iran's attack, the G7 nations said they would work together to ""stabilize the situation"" in the Middle East, according to a statement from Biden. Also, Jordan summoned Iran's ambassador in Amman on Sunday after it intercepted Iranian drones over the country.Meanwhile in Gaza: As thousands of Palestinians were turned away from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, a 5-year-old girl was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers, her mother said. Video showed a man carrying a 5-year-old girl named Sally Abu Laila, who was bleeding from her head, with people crowding around her in panic trying to cover her wound.Also on Sunday: Israel decided to lift its restrictions on large gatherings and to reopen schools on Monday.The US Department of Homeland Security has not identified any “specific or credible threats” to the US since Iran attacked Israel.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link16 hr 14 min agoBlinken calls Turkish, Egyptian, Jordanian and  Saudi counterparts following Iran's attack From CNN's Philip WangUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday spoke with his counterparts in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia following Iran's attacks in Israel, according to readouts from the State Department. During his phone calls, Blinken emphasized the importance of avoiding escalation in the region and the importance of ""a coordinated diplomatic response.""

Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThe United States warned Iran against taking any action against the US or Israel during the UN Security Council emergency session over Iran’s attack on Israel.“Let me be clear, if Iran or its proxies take actions against the US or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible,” US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said Sunday.The United States is “not seeking escalation, our actions have been purely defensive in nature,” adding that the “best way to prevent such escalation is an unambiguous condemnation of the council of Iran’s unprecedented large-scale attack,” he said.The envoy reiterated US support for Israel and condemned Iran’s attack. “Iran’s intent was to cause significant damage and death in Israel,” Wood said.Wood also said the UN Security Council had an “obligation to not let Iran’s actions go unanswered.” “For far too long, Iran has flagrantly violated its international legal obligations,” he said before listing occasions Iran has violated UN Security Council resolutions and international law.Wood accused Iran of being in a “broad sense complicit” of the October 7 attack on Israel by providing “significant funding and training for the military wing of Hamas.”He added the US will explore ""additional measures to hold Iran accountable here in the UN.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

         — 
    


            Oil prices eased on Monday but gold rose and global stocks were mixed as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East spurred demand for safe haven investments after Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel.
    

            The price of Brent crude dipped below $90 a barrel, while US WTI crude dropped by 1% to $84.50 by 4.46 a.m. ET. Traders are waiting to see what Israel does next.
    

            Oil prices hit their highest levels since October on Friday in anticipation of retaliation by Tehran for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria. US crude futures have risen 18% this year. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has surged more than 16%.
    

            Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index ticked up 0.3% in mid-morning trade, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 were up 0.8% and 0.6% respectively. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4%.
    

            Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 0.7% lower, but China’s Shanghai Composite Index finished 1.3% higher.
    

            Spot gold was up 0.3% at $2,349 per ounce on Monday. It had hit an all-time high of $2,431 per ounce on Friday because of fears of a potential attack by Iran on Israel. So far this year, bullion has surged nearly 14%.
    

            US gold futures traded down 0.3% on Monday. They are up 14% this year.

Why Iran attacked Israel and what comes next




            The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which monitors oil markets on behalf of developed economies, said Monday that Iran’s weekend air attacks on Israeli military facilities had raised the risk of increased volatility in oil markets and provided a fresh reminder of the importance of oil security.
    

            Analysts at ANZ said in a research report that the attack would raise concerns about possible disruption to global oil supply.
    

            “The extent of that risk will likely be determined by the reaction of Israel’s government,” the analysts added.
    

            Israel’s war cabinet met for several hours Sunday to discuss its response and was due to meet again at 7 a.m. ET Monday, an Israeli official told CNN.
    

            The Middle East was plunged into uncharted waters after Iran launched scores of missiles toward Israel late Saturday. Israel’s military said “99%” of the more than 300 projectiles were intercepted by Israel and its partners.
    

            Before Iran’s attack, US stocks ended Friday sharply lower, as Wall Street worried about escalating tension in the Middle East.
    

            US stock futures are cautiously higher after US President Joe Biden and his national security team, seeking to contain the risk of a wider regional war, told their counterparts the US will not participate in any counter-strike against Iran.
    

            Dow futures rose 150 points, or 0.4%, in European hours on Monday. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.6%.

      Can China play a role in avoiding an all-out war in the Middle East?

         — 
    


            China has voiced “deep concern” over escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack on Israel, raising the prospect of a wider conflagration in a region where Beijing has pledged to play peacemaker and promote its own security vision.
    

            “(China) calls on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalation,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday, framing the latest tensions as “a spillover from the Gaza conflict” – which it said should be put to an end as soon as possible.
    

            “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” the ministry added.
    

            The Iranian strikes, which Tehran said were retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus on April 1, marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.
    

            The decision by Iran’s leaders to strike at Israel directly has pushed the shadow war between the two regional foes into the open. Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate, as fears grow of an all-out regional war – a scenario Washington has sought to enlist Beijing’s help to avoid.
    

            Following the Damascus strike, which Iran said killed seven people, including two top Iranian military commanders, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to China’s top diplomat Wang Yi – and other counterparts in Turkey and Saudi Arabia – to “make clear that escalation is not in anyone’s interest, and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate,” according to a US State Department spokesperson.
    

            That was not the first time the US had asked China to influence Iran since the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out last October.
    

            In the wake of Houthi rebels’ assaults on commercial shipping in the Red Sea late last year, American officials repeatedly tried to prod Beijing into pressuring Tehran – which is believed to train, fund and equip the Houthis – to rein in the attacks.
    

            The latest flare-up of tensions has again raised questions over how much leverage China wields over Iran – and whether Beijing is willing to turn its political capital into influence.

            “On paper, China has a great deal of potential leverage over Iran,” said William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
    

            China has been Iran’s biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran’s oil exports, providing a lifeline to Tehran against US sanctions. Chinese companies also provide Iran with security and surveillance equipment.
    

            In practice, however, it is difficult for China to pull these levers to influence Iran’s behavior, Figueroa said.
    

            “Weaponizing these trade relations, especially in such a high-profile way, would undermine its greater regional strategy of developing close economic ties throughout the Global South.”
    

            China has greatly expanded its economic and political footprint in the Middle East. In recent years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to “contribute Chinese wisdom to promoting peace and tranquility in the Middle East” as part of his Global Security Initiative to offer an alternative to the Western-led security order.
    

            Last year, Beijing brokered a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two longtime regional rivals, but reining in Iran in the ongoing conflict could prove a thornier task for China, analysts say.
    

            Relations between Beijing and Tehran are already strained by China’s “chronic underinvestment in Iran” despite repeated promises, and previous attempts to influence Iranian policy over the Houthi attacks, Figueroa said.
    

            “While happy to play a role in negotiations, the reality is they lack real coercive power in the region and remain primarily interested in trade and diplomatic initiatives. They are aware of this and not eager to overextend themselves the way they believe the US has done.”
    

            And while China is genuinely concerned about the risk a wider conflict poses to its investment and trade in the region – especially its energy deals, it believes the root cause lies in the conflict in Gaza.
    

            “Therefore, it sees the real solution not in China restraining Iran, but rather in the United States restraining Israel and bringing the conflict to a negotiated settlement that includes a two-state solution,” Figueroa said.
    

    No condemnation for Iranian strikes


            China did not condemn Iran for the weekend’s attack – in contrast to the US and other Western allies, as well as Beijing’s own response following what Tehran says was an Israeli strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month.
    

            Israel did not claim responsibility for the airstrike. However, a military spokesperson told CNN that Israel believes the Iranian building hit in the attack is a “military building of Quds forces” and not a consulate.
    

            Beijing issued a strong condemnation following that airstrike in Damascus.
    

            “The security of diplomatic institutions must not be violated, and the sovereignty and independence of Syria must be respected,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news conference the day after the attack.

            “Amid the ongoing turbulence in the Middle East, we oppose any act that would escalate the tensions.”
    

            Beijing relayed that message to Washington last week, when Wang stressed in his phone call with Blinken that “China strongly condemns the attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria,” according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
    

            Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China is reluctant to condemn Iran for its retaliatory strikes because it sees Tehran as a victim.
    

            “I think the Chinese are particularly sympathetic to Iran given their own experience of the US bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade. That’s why China does not condemn Iran,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.
    

            During a NATO air raid on the former Yugoslavia in 1999, pilots attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade killing three Chinese journalists.
    

            Bill Clinton, US President at the time, apologized to then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and called the bombing a “tragic accident” resulting from faulty intelligence. Beijing meanwhile denounced the strike as a “barbarian act,” with protests erupting outside US diplomatic compounds across China.
    

            “It’s unlikely, therefore, for China to apply pressure on Iran,” Sun said. “For China, had US applies enough pressure on Israel, neither the Israeli attack nor the Iranian retaliation would have taken place. To apply pressure on Iran, which is seen as the victim at the first place, is illogical.”
    

    Reactions from Asia


            The drastic escalation of tensions has drawn stern responses from other countries in Asia.
    

            Japan’s Prime Minister Kishida said he “strongly condemns” Iran’s attack, which “further aggravates the current situation in the Middle East,” and pledged to continue diplomatic efforts to “prevent the situation from worsening and to calm the situation down.”

            India said it was “seriously concerned” about the escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel and closely monitoring the evolving situation.
    

            “We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of diplomacy,” India’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday.
    

            India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke with Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Sunday to share India’s “concern” after the attacks and to discuss the “larger regional situation.” He also spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and “stressed the importance of avoiding escalation, exercising restraint and returning to diplomacy,” according to his post on social platform X.
    

            The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia have also called for restrain from further escalation.

         — 
    


            Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend has ratcheted up tensions in the oil-rich Middle East yet again, threatening to send fuel prices skyward if the conflict escalates and disrupts global supplies.
    

            Iran launched scores of missiles toward Israel late Saturday in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria on April 1. Israel’s military said that “99%” of the more than 300 projectiles were intercepted.
    

            Oil prices spiked Friday to levels not seen since October in anticipation of just such an escalation but on Monday were subdued. Brent, the global benchmark, was trading down 0.9%; West Texas Intermediate futures, the US benchmark, were down 0.8% by 9.25 am ET as markets wait to see how Israel will respond.

Oil prices dip but gold climbs as Israel weighs response to Iran’s attack




            Members of Israel’s war cabinet were locked in heated debate over the nature of its response, with military and diplomatic options both being considered, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN.


            The deepening conflict raises “the risk of increased volatility in oil markets and (provides) a fresh reminder of the importance of oil security,” the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which monitors oil markets on behalf of developed economies, said in a note Monday.
    

            Tensions between Israel and its arch-enemy Iran have ratcheted up since October 7, when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. That attack sparked a devastating response from Israel — more than 30,000 people have died since Israel launched its counter-attack on Gaza, the strip of land controlled by Hamas.
    

            Israel has long accused Iran of engaging in a form of proxy war by backing groups — including Hamas — that have launched attacks on its shores. Tehran has denied any involvement in the October 7 attacks.
    

    The Strait of Hormuz ‘chokepoint’


            Iran’s attack raises the possibility that the conflict could disrupt shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway off the country’s southern border through which more than one quarter of global maritime oil trade — including crude and petroleum products such as gasoline — flows each day.
    

            If the conflict escalates further, Iran has the capability to attack oil tankers passing through the strait using drones, missiles or submarines, Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, told CNN. A worst-case scenario would entail a total blockade of the strait by Tehran, he added, though the likelihood of either of these outcomes is currently low.
    

            “It is the most significant chokepoint in the global oil market,” Richard Bronze, co-founder and analyst at data firm Energy Aspects, told CNN. “Any significant disruption would have a huge impact on global oil supplies and oil prices as a result.”
    

            Iran is a big producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries but exports most of its oil to China because of long-standing international sanctions. Still, a reduction in Iranian oil exports would have a “massive” impact on the global market, according to Bronze, as China would be forced to compete with other countries for supplies elsewhere.
    

            Iran exports up to 1.5 million barrels a day of crude, Bronze said, equivalent to 1.5% of global oil supply. The country produced a total 3.25 million barrels per day of crude in March, IEA data shows.
    





            Disruption or blockages to traffic in the Strait of Hormuz would be a game-changer. “It’s the main or only route for the Middle Eastern oil exporters,” including OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, Bronze said.
    

            Still, Bronze sees the “most likely path from here (to be) de-escalation rather than further escalation,” given open calls by Israel’s allies for it to show restraint.
    

            Another possibility is that the United States, Israel’s most important ally, retaliates by cracking down again on Iran’s oil exports, according to Tagliapietra.
    

            Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 upended energy markets worldwide, Washington has relaxed enforcement of its sanctions on Iran’s oil to keep global supplies — and prices — of the fuel stable, he said.
    

            A renewed crackdown would, however, “create upward pressure on global prices” at an inopportune moment, Tagliapietra said. The US is ju﻿st months from a presidential election where President Joe Biden’s record on gasoline prices, and inflation in general, will be closely scrutinized.
    

    A tight oil market


            Despite Iran’s barrage of drones and missiles, the conflict had a relatively muted impact on the global oil market Monday. Traders had been anticipating a retaliatory attack by Iran since the bombing of its embassy in Damascus in early April, and expected a tightening of global supplies over the coming months, analysts told CNN.
    

            Oil prices have already risen sharply since hitting a low in early February. Brent has climbed more than 16% in that time — closing above $90 a barrel in early April for the first time since October — while WTI has risen nearly 19% to hit $85 a barrel.
    

            “The reason that we’re seeing oil prices off a little bit so far today is that those prices had already risen last week in anticipation of an attack (by Iran),” Bronze, at Energy Aspects, said.
    

            A seasonal uptick in demand as many countries approach the busy summer months, as well as a roaring US economy and signs of an improving Chinese economy, have provided a tailwind for prices, he added, noting that prolonged export curbs by OPEC+ — OPEC plus allies including Russia — have kept global supplies of crude tight.
    

            Still, according to the IEA, output from non-OPEC+ producers, driven by the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada, is expected to come close to meeting the global growth in oil demand this year and next.

      Israel delays Rafah offensive plans amid heated debate over response to Iranian attack, sources say

         — 
    


            Israel was set to take its first steps towards a ground offensive on the Gaza city of Rafah but delayed that campaign after Iran’s weekend attack on their country, which has sparked a heated debate in the war cabinet over how to respond, Israeli sources have told CNN.
    

            The Israeli Air Force was set to begin dropping leaflets on parts of Rafah on Monday, two Israeli sources said, amid preparations for a ground offensive into Gaza’s southernmost city where more than 1 million people are sheltering.
    

            Those plans were paused after a retaliatory weekend attack from Iran, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired towards Israel, the vast majority of which were intercepted by Israel and its partners.
    

            One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, although the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment.
    

            The Israeli military declined to comment.
    

            The war cabinet meanwhile remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convened Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, the officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.
    

            Monday’s meeting ended late afternoon local time, an Israeli official confirmed to CNN, adding they had no initial details on what was discussed or decided.

Israel weighs response after Iran fires missile barrage




            Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision.
    

            Gantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran’s attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, the sources said. Multiple countries are already cautioning Israel against escalating the situation further with a military response.
    

            Israel’s government is aware that the country is currently enjoying international support and good will from its allies and does not want to squander that. At the same time, the government recognizes that it cannot allow Iran’s first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.
    

            Among the military options that are being considered, the war cabinet is consider an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message, but would avoid causing casualties, one Israeli official said.
    

            But Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, hence the ongoing debate. The timing of a decision remains unclear.
    

    Pressure to de-escalate


            Netanyahu has been facing international pressure to de-escalate a fraught situation after Iran’s weekend attack.
    

            The attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month, which killed at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi.
    

            An hours-long war cabinet meeting on Sunday ended without a decision on how Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, an Israeli official said.
    

            US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu after the weekend attack, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            But Gantz urged on Sunday the need to “build a regional coalition and exact a price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.”
    

            Israel and Iran have long been rivals, but tensions escalated in the wake of Hamas’ attacks on Israel, which left about 1,200 people dead. Iran backs a web of proxies across the Middle East that have frequently clashed with Israel since the attacks.
    

    Offensive looming in Rafah


            Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas’s remaining battalions, despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive.
    

            The future of the war in Gaza and a coming ground offensive in Rafah are also factoring into the war cabinet’s debate about a potential response to Iran’s attack.
    

            A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military’s attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel’s government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.

            American officials reiterated last week that the US has not seen anything resembling a comprehensive plan from the Israelis on how they would carry out such an operation, including first moving the majority of the estimated 1.4 million civilians out of Rafah.
    

            Palestinians from across Gaza fled to the city, in the south of the enclave, in the early stages of the war to escape an advancing Israeli military.
    

            But with the Egyptian border to the south closed, there is no clear escape route for those Palestinians, many of whom are living in tents surrounding the city.

Benjamin Cremel/WPA Pool/Getty ImagesBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Monday that he will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express “solidarity with Israel” in the face of Iran’s attack and discuss how to “prevent further escalation.” “We are working urgently with our allies to de-escalate the situation and prevent further bloodshed,” Sunak told the House of Commons on Monday, adding: “We want to see calmer heads prevail and we are directing all our diplomatic efforts to that end.” Sunak explained “all sides must show restraint” and noted that G7 leaders will work together to coordinate “diplomatic measures” over the coming days. The British prime minister condemned Iran for seeking to “plunge the Middle East into a new crisis” and detailed: “The scale of the attack and the fact that it was targeted directly at Israel are without precedent. It was a reckless and dangerous escalation.” share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 29 min agoBlinken: US is ""coordinating a diplomatic response to seek to prevent escalation"" after Iran strike on IsraelFrom CNN's Jennifer HanslerU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken holds a news conference at the State Department Harry S. Truman headquarters on March 13, in Washington, D.C.  Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday the US has spent the past 36 hours “coordinating a diplomatic response to seek to prevent escalation” following a retaliatory Iranian attack on Israel this weekend.“Strength and wisdom need to be different sides of the same coin,” Blinken said in a seemingly implicit call for Israel to exercise restraint in its response. Blinken noted he has been in contact with counterparts in the region “and will continue to do so in the hours and days ahead.”“We don’t seek escalation but will continue to support the defense of Israel and protect our personnel in the region,” Blinken said in his first public comments about the attack this weekend.As CNN reported, President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US would not participate in offensive moves against Iran. But, he added that ""what this weekend demonstrated is that Israel did not have to and does not have to defend itself alone when it is the victim of aggression, the victim of an attack.""share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 43 min agoIsrael's war cabinet meeting on Iran attack response has endedFrom CNN's Eugenia YosefAn Israeli official has confirmed to CNN that the war cabinet meeting is over. The official said that at this stage they had no details on what was discussed or decided.The war cabinet met to deliberate over the timing and scope of a response to Iran's attack on Israel, the officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link2 hr 19 min agoIsraeli gunfire kills 1 and critically wounds another in West Bank, Palestinian health ministry saysFrom Ami Kaufman and CNN's Eyad Kourdi Palestinians inspect the car of a man who was injured in an Israeli raid in the West Bank city of Nablus, on April 15. Alaa Badarneh/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockIsraeli gunfire killed one person and critically wounded another in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank, on Monday, the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Health said. The ministry said the other person had a critical chest injury ""due to occupation forces' gunfire in Nablus.""For their part, Israeli police say that security forces killed what they described as a  “terrorist” in Nablus in the occupied West Bank during an operation to arrest a wanted man. It said border police, together with Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered Nablus to arrest a wanted person in a statement Monday. As the arrest was made, “violent disturbances against the forces began” and a man who threw an explosive device at the Israeli forces was shot dead.“In addition to this, another person who disrupted order was shot in the leg after endangering the security of the forces.”Security forces also opened fire on a “suspicious vehicle” that drove toward the forces at speed and did not respond to their calls, resulting in the injury of the driver of the vehicle.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3 hr 9 min agoIsrael is delaying its ground operation in Rafah, sources tell CNN From CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel AvivA general view from the makeshift tents where Palestinian families taking shelter in Rafah, Gaza, on February 18. Abed Zagout/Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Rafah this week, but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli sources tell CNN.Iran launched 300 missiles and drones toward Israel overnight Sunday, bringing a new phase of tension, uncertainty and confrontation in the Middle East.The attack has prompted Israel to delay its plans for an offensive in Rafah, where more than a million people are currently sheltering. The Israeli Air Force had planned on dropping leaflets on parts of the city on Monday, the sources said. One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in the southern city, although the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment. The Israeli military declined to comment.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas’s remaining battalions, despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive. The future of the war in Gaza and a coming ground offensive in Rafah are also factoring into the war cabinet’s debate about a potential response to Iran’s attack.A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military’s attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel’s government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3 hr 21 min agoBiden focused on preventing Iran attack from spiraling into wider regional conflict, White House official saysFrom CNN’s Sam Fossum President Joe Biden meets with members of the National Security team regarding the unfolding missile attacks on Israel from Iran on Saturday evening in the White House Situation Room. Some portions of this handout photo have been blurred by the source. Adam Schultz/The White HouseWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby reiterated Monday morning that President Joe Biden is focused on preventing Iran’s attack against Israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict. “Just because Iran conducted this unprecedented attack, which we and our Israeli partners and other partners thwarted, doesn't mean that we should just accept a constant rising escalation in the region. The President is not going to accept that he wants to see things de-escalate,” Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan this morning.Pressed on whether it’s the White House position that Israel should not retaliate, Kirby said that’s ultimately up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government but that the US wants to see tensions de-escalate. “We respect their sovereign decision-making process. What we want to see is de-escalation of the tensions. We don't want to see a wider war,"" Kirby said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3 hr 44 min agoPalestinian girl shot in mother's arms as they attempted to return to home in northern GazaFrom Mohammad Al-Sawalhi in Gaza and CNN’s Abeer Salman, Kareem Khadder and Zeena Saifi in JerusalemAs chaos ensued after thousands of Palestinians were turned away from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, a 5-year-old girl was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers, her mother said.Video shows a man carrying a 5-year-old girl named Sally Abu Laila, who was bleeding from her head, with people crowding around her in panic trying to cover her wound.Her mother Sabreen told CNN her daughter was in her arms when Israeli soldiers shot at her. Sabreen, alongside her four children, was trying to cross through the checkpoint, when two young men squeezed in between her and other women waiting in line, prompting Israeli soldiers to fire at them.“I tried to put my daughter on the ground to walk, but she couldn’t move. I saw my hands covered in blood. I called on her, ‘Sally! Sally! Sally!’, but she didn’t answer” Sabreen said.Eventually, she said she managed to get to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital where her daughter is undergoing treatment. She told CNN she is still in intensive care. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on reports that its soldiers fired shots at civilians trying to head up north, but has not received a response.Earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said reports that people could return to their homes in northern Gaza were false. “The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted,” IDF said.Read more about what happened to thousands of Palestinians as they attempted to return home here.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4 hr 44 min agoIsrael's war cabinet is still debating how to respond to Iran attack, officials sayFrom CNN’s Jeremy Diamond in Tel AvivThis handout photo, released early Sunday local time, shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second from left, as he meets with members of his war cabinet at the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, Israel. Portions of this photo have been blurred by the source. Ariel Hermoni/Israeli Ministry of Defense/FileIsrael’s war cabinet has been engaged in a heated debate about how and when to respond to Iran’s weekend attack on their country, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations tell CNN.The war cabinet remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convenes Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, the officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision. Gantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran’s attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, one of the sources said. Multiple countries are already cautioning Israel against escalating the situation further with a military response.Israel’s government is aware that the country is currently enjoying international support and goodwill from its allies and does not want to squander that. At the same time, the government recognizes that it cannot allow Iran’s first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.Among the military options that are being considered, the war cabinet is considering an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message, but would avoid causing casualties, one Israeli official said. But Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, hence the ongoing debate. The timing of a decision remains unclear.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4 hr 52 min agoJordan's foreign minister says Netanyahu is using confrontation with Iran to take attention away from GazaFrom CNN’s Celine AlkhaldiRescue workers search in the rubble of a building annexed to the Iranian embassy a day after an Israeli air strike in Damascus, Syria, on April 2. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty ImagesJordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi told CNN Monday he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is using the fight with Iran to take attention away from the war on Gaza.""The Israeli Prime Minister has always wanted to invoke some sort of confrontation with Iran. Now, as the international pressure on Israel to stop the aggression on Gaza continues, invoking a fight with Iran is something that, we believe, he thinks could dilute that pressure, and could take attention away from Gaza,"" Safadi told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “The issue is in Gaza and the West Bank, and our focus needs to continue to be on that because unless we solve that, then the chances for regional escalation will continue,” Safadi said.More on Iran's attack: Safadi said Jordan will do whatever is within its means to protect the kingdom, explaining why the country intercepted some of the drones and missiles that entered its airspace Saturday night.“What we did was consistent with our long-standing policy and any projectiles, drones, whatever that enters our space historically and we'll continue to deal with it because it poses a threat to Jordan,” Safadi said. “We are in the range of fire and any missiles or projectile that could fall in Jordan would cause harm to Jordan. So we did what we have to do and let me be very clear. We will do the same regardless of where those drones are from. From Israel, from Iran, from anybody else,” he added.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

					TikToker Elica Le Bon said Iranians like her only want peace. 				



An Iranian-American lawyer and TikToker hit out at the Islamic Republic’s regime and its cheerleaders advocating for a war with Israel, arguing that everyday Iranians only “want peace.”
Elica Le Bon, a British-born, American-educated attorney boasting more than 300,000 followers across the various social media platforms, released a video on TikTok Sunday carrying a powerful anti-war message that has gone viral, drawing more than a million views.
“Hi, Iranian woman here,” Le Bon says at the start of the clip. “It’s become very apparent that you haven’t been listening to anything that we’ve had to say for the past two years, but I was wondering if you could just lend me a few minutes of your time in this ungodly hour to hear us now.”

Le Bon, who has used her online clout to combat Iranian propaganda and disinformation in recent years, blasted supporters of the Tehran regime for backing the historic drone and missile attack on Israel Saturday by arguing that it was an act of self-defense following an Israeli strike on an Iranian embassy complex in Syria.

“In what capacity have you distorted the story to make the Islamic Republic the victim?” Le Bon incredulously wondered.
Le Bon drew a distinction between the nation of Iran and its ruling regime, insisting that what the hardliner theocratic government does “is not a reflection of the Iranian people.”
“We’ve been clear about what we want, which is peace,” she proclaimed.
The influencer further took pro-Tehran commenters to task for turning a blind eye to the mass protests led by Iranian women demanding reforms who are being jailed and killed for their activism, only to come out in full force to support the attack on Israel.
“When we were screaming that they were killing Iranian women for not wearing a hijab, where were you?” Le Bon demanded. “When they were lynching Iranian men from cranes for protesting, where were you? When we were explaining that it’s a terrorist occupying force, where were you?”
“But all of a sudden everyone’s graduated from Instagram school of law to say that it’s a violation of international law and Iran has the right to defend itself,” she seethed.

Le Bon went on to argue that far from being a victim, the Islamic Republic of Iran was the aggressor responsible for creating “terror proxies,” including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen, for the sole purpose of fostering regional instability.
“Did you think they were there to instigate a system of public schooling and education, to feed the poor, house the unhoused? What did you think that they were there for?” she sarcastically remarked.
Le Bon also bristled at Iran’s claim that the Israeli bombing of its compound in Damascus on April 1 was an act of war, pointing out that it came after Hamas launched a murderous attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and that Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel “on a near daily basis.”
“Iranians don’t want war with Israel. We want peace with Israel. Iranian people inside of Iran have come out and said this over, and over and over again,” Le Bon said.

The Israeli government was said to be mulling a retaliation for Saturday’s Iranian barrage that saw more than 300 drones and missiles rain down on its territory, leaving a 7-year-old girl seriously injured.
Israel’s European allies urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet to show restraint and avoid escalating the conflict further amid the ongoing war with Hamas.

Shocking video captured anti-Israel activists in Chicago chanting “death to Israel” and “death to America” in Farsi  over the weekend, just hours before Iran launched its anticipated drone and missile attack on the Jewish state.
The chants in Iran’s native language were recorded during a “break out session” for the Anti-War Committee Chicago on Saturday, where organizer Shabbir Rizvi taught about 80 participants how to say “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” in Farsi, The Free Press reported. 
Rizvi tells attendees he is about to teach them a saying they can use if they ever encounter “Zionist freaks.” 
He then leads the so-called anti-war group in a chant of “Marg bar Israel.”
After the chant concludes Rizvi clarifies to attendees that the saying “has two meanings, depending on who’s asking.”

To teach the attendees — nearly all of whom are wearing black KF94 masks — the chant, he jokes that it’s like saying “margarita bar.”
Later, the crowd laughs as Rizvi explains, “It can either mean, ‘death to,’ or ‘down with.'” 
After teaching the leftists how to saying “death to Israel,” one person chimes in: “Can we get a marg bar America?”
Rizvi can be seen raising his hands in the air and leading the crowd like a conductor in a chant of “Marg bar America!” 
The disturbing incident occurred mere hours before Iran’s anticipated attack on Israel on Saturday. 



The video was taken Saturday ahead of Iran’s anticipated attack on Israel.  Getty Images
The move comes in retaliation after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
 Saturday’s strike saw some 300 drones and missiles launched from within the Islamic Republic — as well as from proxies in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon toward Israel. 
Only one casualty — a 7-year-old Israeli-Arab girl — has been identified so far.

The “vast majority” of the missiles were intercepted outside of air space, by Israeli air defenses, with the help of US, French and UK ships and warplanes shooting them out of the sky. 
Fighter jets from Jordan also assisted, though the Middle Eastern country claimed it was not helping Israel but rather defending its own air space.

President Biden is “sleepwalking” the US into another “catastrophic” war in the Middle East, an expert says, as Israel prepares a retaliatory strike after Iran’s historic missile bombardment over the weekend.
Biden, 81, is facing mounting pressure to silence critics who claim he’s allowed tensions in the region to escalate, as the threat of an Israeli counterstrike on Iran looms.

President Joe Biden has been accused of “sleepwalking” the US into yet another “catastrophic” war in the Middle East. AP
“The strategy of the Biden administration has failed miserably. Biden is sleepwalking the US into another catastrophic war in the Middle East,” Fawaz Gerges, professor of International Relations and Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics told NBC News.
“His overarching goal of preventing the war in Gaza from escalating into neighboring countries has failed. Biden has failed to influence [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s decisions either in Gaza or towards Iran.”






Elsewhere, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Peter Lerner confirmed on Monday that Israel’s retaliation could mean “strike or no strike.”
Lerner said that they are considering a “wide range of options” as there are “a lot of different scenarios” to consider.
He told reporters that the Israeli government will “decide on the steps forward” in the coming days.

“Just because we were successful in intercepting, we shouldn’t underestimate what Iran did,” Lerner added.
Netanyahu’s war cabinet was expected to meet Monday afternoon local time to decide on Israel’s next steps.
Israeli officials said the war cabinet favored retaliation but was split over the timing and scale of the response.

Biden has warned Netanyahu the US will not participate in any Israeli counteroffensive against Iran, American officials said.
With Israel and Iran now teetering on the brink of open warfare, Jerusalem’s European allies rushed to call for restraint.
“We’re on the edge of the cliff and we have to move away from it,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. “We have to step on the brakes and reverse gear.”

UK’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron sought to downplay Saturday night’s attack, which saw more than 300 Iranian kamikaze drones and missiles fired into Israel, as he strongly advocated against an escalation.
“Of course if you’re sitting in Israel this morning, you’re thinking quite rightly, ‘We have every right to respond,’ and they do,” he told Sky News. “But we are urging that they should not escalate.”
“In many ways this has been a double defeat for Iran,” Cameron continued. “The attack has been almost a total failure and they revealed to the world that they are the malign influence in the region prepared to do this. So our hope is that there won’t be a retaliatory response.”

French President Emmanuel Macron likewise urged Israel to set its sight on isolating Iran rather than escalating the situation — while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned Iran not to carry out more attacks.
The unprecedented Iranian attack, which was launched in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on its embassy in Syria on April 1, caused fairly minor damage, with most of the missiles and drones being shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome defenses and allied forces from the US, France, the UK and Jordan.

The only serious injury reported inside Israel was a 7-year-old girl from a Bedouin community who was struck in the head by shrapnel.
The child, who was not unidentified, remained in a life-threatening condition at Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba after undergoing surgery, reported Times of Israel.
“It fell on us into the house at around 2 in the morning. She was sleeping in the house and we immediately took her to Soroka hospital,” the girl’s father Mohammed said.

President Joe Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the US will not take part in a counter-offensive against Iran, an option Netanyahu’s war cabinet favors after a mass drone and missile attack on Israeli territory, according to officials.
The threat of open warfare erupting between the arch Middle East foes and dragging in the United States put the region on edge, triggering calls for restraint from global powers and Arab nations.
“The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a Security Council meeting called on Sunday in response to the strikes.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood called on the council to unequivocally condemn Iran’s attack.

“Let me be clear: if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible,” he said.

Still, Biden told Netanyahu the US would not participate in any Israeli counter-offensive against Iran over the attack, a White House official said.
US State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke to counterparts including in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, stressing the need to avoid escalation, the importance of a coordinated diplomatic response, and emphasizing the US will continue to support Israel’s defense.
LITTLE SERIOUS DAMAGE
Iran launched the attack over a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed top Revolutionary Guards commanders and followed months of clashes between Israel and Iran’s regional allies, triggered by the war in Gaza.

However, the attack by more than 300 missiles and drones caused only modest damage in Israel. Most were shot down by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system and with help from the US, Britain, France and Jordan.
The only serious injury reported within Israel was a 7-year-old who was hurt by shrapnel.
There also was little serious property damage reported. Authorities said an Israeli Air Force base was hit but continued to operate as normal.

Asian shares fell and gold prices rose on Monday as risk sentiment took a hit, though oil prices dipped.
“An attack was largely priced in the days leading up to it. Also the limited damage and the fact that there was no loss of life means that maybe Israel’s response will be more measured,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING.
“But clearly, there is still plenty of uncertainty and it all depends on how Israel now responds.”

Israeli officials said Netanyahu’s five-member war cabinet favored retaliation in a meeting on Sunday, although the panel was divided over the timing and scale of any such response.
Two senior Israeli ministers signalled retaliation was not imminent and that Israel would not act alone.
“We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” centrist minister Benny Gantz said ahead of a war cabinet meeting.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said Israel had an opportunity to form a strategic alliance “against this grave threat by Iran.”
Israel remained on high alert, but authorities lifted some emergency measures that had included a ban on some school
activities and caps on large gatherings.

Iranian army chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said on television, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran,” and told Washington that its bases could also be attacked if it helped Israel retaliate.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Tehran had informed the United States its attack on Israel would be limited and for self-defense and that regional neighbors had been informed of its planned strikes 72 hours in advance.
Turkish, Jordanian and Iraqi officials said on Sunday that Iran gave wide notice days before the attack, but US officials said Tehran did not warn Washington and was aiming to cause significant damage.

The leaders of the Group of 7 nations condemned Iran’s attack and said they would work to stabilize the situation, warning in a statement that Tehran risked “an uncontrollable regional escalation.”
MOTIVATIONS FOR ATTACK DEBATED
Analysts debated whether Iran’s attack was calibrated to cause genuine devastation in Israel, or to save face at home after vows of revenge while avoiding a major new war.
“I think the Iranians took into consideration the fact that Israel has a very, very strong multi-layer anti-missile system and they probably took into consideration that there will not be too many casualties,” said Sima Shine, a former senior Mossad official at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.

		Biden tells Netanyahu US will not engage in counteroffensive against Iran, calls Saturday a win for Israel: report	





In Gaza, Iran’s attack drew applause as rare payback for an Israeli offensive that has killed at least 33,000 people.
“We have been slaughtered for over six months and no one dared to do anything. Now Iran, after its consulate was hit, is hitting back at Israel and this brings joy into our hearts,” said Majed Abu Hamza of Gaza City.
The war in Gaza, which Israel invaded after an attack by Iran-backed Hamas on Oct. 7, has spread to fronts with Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
In Israel, although there was alarm at the first direct attack from another country in more than three decades, the mood contrasted with the trauma after the Hamas-led attack on Oct.7.
“I think we’ve been given license to respond now. I mean it was a major attack from Iran… I imagine Israel will respond and may be over quickly and get back to normal life,” said Jeremy Smith, 60.
In Iran, state television showed small gatherings in several cities celebrating the attack, but in private some Iranians were worried about Israel’s response.
“Iran gave Netanyahu a golden opportunity to attack our country. But we, the people of Iran, will bear the brunt of this conflict,” said Shima, a nurse, from Tehran.

					President Joe Biden's desperation for a renewed nuclear deal was never clearer than in October, just days after the Hamas massacre, says columnist Richard Goldberg. 						
							AP/Alex Brandon						




President Biden needs to face reality: His policies of appeasing Iran while waging political warfare against Israel led Tehran to conclude it could launch a massive attack on Israel and face no consequences. 
As Biden again tries to hold Israel back from defending itself while maintaining both United States and United Nations sanctions relief for Iran, he risks confirming the ayatollah’s calculation — and guaranteeing a more dangerous future for America and our democratic allies.
Iran’s weekend attack against Israel was not symbolic or performative — it was an unprecedented and unacceptable act of war. 
There’s no other way to characterize the launch of 120 ballistic missiles, alongside 30 cruise missiles and 170 suicide drones, against a country the size of New Jersey — especially when the attack was committed by the state sponsor of terrorism already waging a multifront proxy war against that country.
Two questions now loom largest: Why did this happen and what is to be done?
Wasted diplomacy

Over the past six months, Washington has pressured Jerusalem not to escalate against Iran’s terror proxy in southern Lebanon, despite the daily launch of missiles, rockets and drones that has forced towns across northern Israel to evacuate.

Hezbollah’s war on Israel has been normalized due to the lack of severe consequences imposed on the group and its sponsor. 
The same can be said for the near-daily missile and drone attacks on the Red Sea by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, where the US won’t even put the group on an official terror list let alone impose true military costs on its leaders.
All the while, the White House has been showering Tehran with access to cash in hopes of incentivizing better behavior — a policy more commonly known as appeasement. 
America today does not enforce its oil sanctions on Iran, allowing Iranian crude to freely flow to China and other Asian destinations. 
Just last month, Biden renewed a sanctions waiver giving Iran access to upwards of $10 billion to be used as budget support.
Biden’s desperation for a renewed nuclear deal was never clearer than in October, just days after the Hamas massacre, when he allowed the UN’s missile embargo on Iran to expire rather than work with European allies to trigger the “snapback” of UN sanctions — a mechanism to restore all multilateral restrictions on Iran without a Russian or Chinese veto.
Oct. 7 accountability
Iran has faced no consequences from the US for Oct. 7, despite years of funding, training and arming Hamas. 
Nor has Iran faced consequences for directing missile attacks against Israel from Lebanon, missile attacks against the US Navy from Yemen and missile and drone attacks on both Israel and US forces from Iraq and Syria — even after the murder of three American soldiers.

		Biden should draw red lines for Hamas — not Israel	





Instead, the president’s public wrath in recent weeks has been aimed at Israel: pressuring Israel to halt its campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza, threatening a cutoff of US support, doing nothing to stop Canada from halting arms sales and emboldening Democrats in Congress to call for conditioning American aid. 
It’s quite logical for the mullahs to examine the record and conclude a strategic-level strike on Israel would end in two results: zero consequences for Tehran and pressure on Israel not to respond. As of this moment, they are being proven right.
Israel, however, has no choice but to respond forcefully to this attack — imposing costs high enough on Tehran to turn the ayatollah’s calculation into a miscalculation. 
Normalizing ballistic and cruise missile strikes from Iranian territory — whether they succeed in breaking through Israeli missile defenses or not — will establish a new and outrageously high baseline for future escalation. It may also inform the regime’s calculus on whether and when to pursue a nuclear breakout, doubting there is any level of misbehavior that could break Western appeasement policies.
Stop Tehran cash flow 
The president reportedly wants Israel to hold off on a military retaliation so he can pursue diplomatic options instead. 
But if those options exclude economic and political costs for the regime, Biden will simply be putting lipstick on a policy of accommodation.

The president should immediately freeze the $10 billion made available to Iran through his own sanctions waiver — money that’s accessible right now in bank accounts in Iraq, Oman and Europe. 
He should order a crackdown on Chinese imports of Iranian crude, too. If he refuses, the Senate should finally vote on two House-passed bills that would force his hand on both matters.
On the multilateral stage, the White House should join with the United Kingdom, France and Germany in triggering the snapback of UN sanctions and press Britain, Canada and the European Union to finally designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. Canada should be pressured to lift its arms embargo on Israel, too.
Both the US and Israel must recognize Iran carried out its attack despite a week of warnings from both countries. That is not a “win” — that’s a national-security failure, which should compel an immediate change in strategy.

		Hooray for Israel! Now Biden should back Israel’s  response vs. Iran — no ifs, ands or buts	


		By
		
Post Editorial Board





























		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.

Published

					President Joe Biden should be backing an Israeli response, writes The Post Editorial Board. 						
							REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz						




Hooray for the good guys!
Israel, with the help of allies, took out 99% of the 300-plus attack drones, cruise and ballistic missiles Iran fired at it over the weekend. 
It’s a stunning victory!
President Biden and leaders of France, Britain and even Jordan deserve praise for helping to repel the outrageous strike.
Yes, Israelis went through hell, scurrying to shelters late at night, unsure if the missiles and drones would reach them.

Fortunately, only a few did, causing minimal damage — though one 7-year-old, sadly, was seriously injured.

								Don’t overlook the Chinese threat							










Still, such a massive attack, directly by Iran, might never have happened at all if not for catastrophic Biden administration policy.
Nor can it go unanswered.
And Biden should be backing an Israeli response, not looking to thwart it.
Tehran had vowed to hit the Jewish state after an Israeli airstrike on a Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards hub in Damascus killed a key commander, Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
Zahedi had overseen operations by Hezbollah (essentially, Iran’s military wing in Lebanon) and coordinated with other terror groups.
He’s suspected of having played a role in Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre of Israelis as well as the drone strike that killed three US soldiers in Jordan.

The media wrongly portray Iran’s strike attack as “retaliation,” but it was Israel’s killing of Zahedi that was retaliation, and a preemptive move to thwart further strikes.
(You could well argue that America itself should’ve taken out that Damascus facility, and Zahedi, after the murder of US soldiers.)
Iran’s weekend barrage was, in fact, escalation, not only because Zahedi had it coming, but because it was launched directly by Iran itself, not by proxies — and, for the first time ever, from its own soil, at Israel’s soil.

editorial



		As Iran readies to attack Israel, remember this is Biden’s design	






Where did Tehran’s leaders get the idea they can get away with such a volatile move?
From the White House — and Democratic critics like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
For months, Biden has scolded Israel for its drive to wipe out Hamas after its Oct. 7 slaughterfest.
He and his team have worked overtime to prevent the Jewish state from attacking Hamas’ remaining battalions in Rafah, citing potential harm to civilians.
Iran saw Washington distancing itself from Jerusalem and figured it wouldn’t back it if attacked.
Tehran also knows Team Biden’s eager to carry out the Obama policy of appeasing Iran in a deranged bid to bolster ties and perhaps reform the mullahs.
Team Obama, recall, provided Iran with tens of billions of dollars, in exchange for a disastrous nuclear deal that, thank goodness, President Donald Trump discarded.
Alas, Biden has tried to revive that deal, and, to that end, he’s allowed Iran to violate sanctions and reap billions in oil sales with impunity.
He’s also freed up billions in additional frozen funds and even let UN sanctions on Iran’s missiles and drones (the kind used in its weekend attack) lapse.

		Biden is dreaming it’s like 1918, but Israel is fighting like it’s 1945	





Most troubling, he’s failed to respond meaningfully to attacks and provocations by Iran’s proxies.
After Oct. 7, he told anyone thinking of joining in the attacks, “don’t.”
Yet Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iranian-backed militias nonetheless have launched drones and rockets at Israeli and Western targets almost daily since then.
Last week, amid reports of an imminent Iranian attack, he again warned “don’t.”
Tehran’s answer? Some 300 airborne drones, missiles and rockets from Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Iran itself. Hezbollah fired an additional 30 rockets from Lebanon.
Iran read Biden correctly: Even after such blatant defiance, on Sunday he urged Israel to “pocket the win” and not retaliate, per a White House source. Indeed, US and Western officials reportedly want both Israel and Iran to feel victorious, as a way to deescalate.
Huh? Iran should feel victorious and not suffer reprisals? It’s beyond nuts — and utterly unrealistic.
After undermining Israel for months, Biden should be supporting Israel — no ifs, and or buts — in its response to Iran’s attacks.

Israel will figure out its response on its own, but no nation can let another let such a massive attack go unanswered, even if it manages to prevent great damage.
That would only greenlight more attacks.
 Since Oct. 7, Biden’s overriding goal has been to prevent escalation.
This weekend showed he’s failed spectacularly.
He mustn’t stick to the same policy, restraint and appeasement, that caused the failure.
There’s a word for doing so: insanity.

Jerusalem, undoubtedly, will strike back at Tehran. 
It likely will be big, loud and intended to reestablish Israeli deterrence in the Mideast.
But it must come with an endgame.
Iran is a target-rich environment for Israel Defense Forces planners — and Tehran is vulnerable to attack, particularly given Israel’s own extensive intercontinental-ballistic-missile arsenal and F-35 stealth fighter-bomber fleet.
Israel’s menu options are nearly endless. 

Iranian leadership, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps command and control, conventional military bases, air-defense systems, Iran’s oil export industry — and its nuclear-weapons program.

								Wild video shows leftwing activists in Chicago chant ‘death to Israel, death to America’ in Farsi							









 



								US will not take part in any Israeli retaliatory action against Iran							










The last presents Jerusalem a very real and existential danger. 
All the more after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demonstrated Iran’s willingness to cross the Rubicon Saturday by attacking Israel directly.
Eliminating that threat is not an easy lift. 
Iran has 38 known nuclear-program facilities spread throughout a country only marginally smaller than the state of Alaska. 
Destroying Tehran’s emerging nuclear-weapons capacity will entail destroying centrifuge facilities at the Natanz and Fordow fuel-enrichment plants, where Iran is likely in the process of enriching uranium to a 90% weapons-grade level.

		Iran’s terror-enabling supreme leader only opens the door for Israel to hit back hard	





It also requires taking out numerous undeclared sites, ICBM production facilities, launch sites and existing stockpiles of weapon systems capable of carrying a nuclear payload and delivering it — including, potentially, Iranian submarines.
But will it be enough regardless of what the IDF hits?
Not likely.
Israel is going to climb the escalation ladder. 
But Jerusalem alongside Washington should consider a multilayered approach to eliminating Iran as a regional threat (and potentially a direct threat to America) rather than, as Team Biden prefers, simply appeasing it.
For decades, the West has ignored opportunities to exploit significant Iranian domestic opposition to the ayatollahs. 
President Barack Obama withheld support for the 2009 Green Movement, then ignored Iran’s declining influence after the early 2010s Arab Spring. 
And President Biden’s done the same as women bravely stand up to the suppression of women’s rights only to be brutally tortured and many murdered by Iran’s notorious “morality squads” or executed after sham trials.
Dissidents, women in particular, may be the secret sauce of smiting the ayatollahs — and realigning Iran into a representative democracy.

Israel’s security could, allegorically speaking, depend on the West’s ability to build an army of modern-day Iranian “Esthers.” 
Esther was the Jewish queen who foiled Haman’s sixth-century BCE plot to kill Persia’s Jews.
Washington has opted to ignore the repeated domestic waves of Iranian efforts to topple the mullahs. 
The Obama and Biden administrations instead looked to check Iran and its nuclear-weapons program by concentrating on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — in which America released more than $150 billion of Iranian frozen assets in hard US currency.

		How Israel defeated 99% of Iran missiles and drones — with the help of US and an unlikely ally	






Iran has used that money to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and other IRGC-sponsored militias, including Yemen’s Houthis. 
Biden even considered lifting sanctions in 2021 if Tehran returned to the JCPOA. 
Removing the Houthis from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list was Biden’s first misstep in that direction.
Simply put, Khamenei and his mullahs need to go. Negotiating is no longer an option. 
Biden and Israel should recall the Trump administration’s “maximum-pressure campaign” against Iran helped fuel the domestic unrest that gave Iranian women a rare opening to begin protesting against the mullahs — a movement that quickly became countrywide.
To that end, as the IDF dials in its reprisal aims, Jerusalem should consider targets likely to destabilize Khamenei’s regime. 
Hitting Iran’s nuclear facilities and defense industries are the right strategic moves, but taking out the ayatollah’s domestic instruments of power might prove equally as valuable.
Israel’s David-versus-Goliath opportunity is at hand. 
Purposely striking Khamenei’s police forces, morality courts and other highly visible pressure points in Tehran and elsewhere could prove to be a slingshot-like force multiplier.
Especially if the United States recognizes the opening it’s likely to create — and begins actively aiding and funding Iranian dissidents to take on Khamenei at a grassroots level, while Israel’s militarily takes on Iran from high above.

Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Khamenei’s morality police murdered for not wearing a hijab properly, is Iran’s guiding star in waiting and the would-be face of its potential deliverance. 
Empowering her legacy by tapping into Iran’s dissidents might prove to be Israel and Washington’s ultimate endgame for Iran and its people’s own deliverance.

Saturday’s attacks on Israel created new questions about replenishing aid to war-torn Ukraine after months of tumultuous Republican infighting.
Iran’s unprecedented flurry of strikes on Israel sparked new urgency in Congress for additional military aid to the Jewish state as various Republican factions are seizing on the development to further their arguments on Ukraine.
Ukraine aid being taken up this week now appears to be a long shot.

“We’re stretched way too thin, [with] the number of weapon systems that we need, Ukraine needs, that Taiwan needs, that Israel needs. And we can’t do all of these things at once,” Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.

“When you’re stretched too thin, you’ve got to focus and you’ve got to rebuild your own country,” he went on. “Can we possibly fight all of those conflicts at once? No.”
Vance contended that the US should be encouraging Ukraine “to take a defensive posture” against the Russian invasion of their lands and place more focus on Israel instead.
In sharp contrast, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seized on Iran’s brutal attack, calling it a “wake-up call” for the West.
“It is critical that the United States Congress make the necessary decisions to strengthen America’s allies at this critical time,” Zelensky pleaded.

Ukraine condemns Iran’s attack on Israel using “Shahed” drones and missiles. We in Ukraine know very well the horror of similar attacks by Russia, which uses the same “Shahed” drones and Russian missiles, the same tactics of mass air strikes.Every effort must be made to prevent…— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) April 14, 2024

A chorus of foreign policy luminaries within the GOP echoed that sentiment.
“These rockets and these drones are being bought by Russia, and they’re killing Ukrainians every day. What happened in Israel last night, happens in Ukraine every night,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) lamented to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
“The power grid is under threat right now. If the power grid goes out in Ukraine altogether, we don’t have time on our side here.”
McCaul noted that while “this is a speaker determination” as to when the House takes up a foreign aid bill for Ukraine, his “preference is this week.”

“Iran, Russia and China have engaged in an unholy alliance to undermine and destabilize the US, Israel and the free world,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) said after Iran’s attack.
“We must act decisively — Congress must pass aid to Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan.”
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-Ohio) stressed that the clock is ticking for Ukraine amid multiple setbacks on the battlefield to fend off the Russian invaders.
“Everyone has been very much on this side of understanding that we’re at a critical point. Russia is beginning to gain ground, Ukraine is beginning to lose the ability to defend itself,” Turner told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” 
“The United States must step up and provide Ukraine the weapons that they need, and I think we’re gonna see overwhelming support for that in the House this week.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was coy about the exact timeline he is pursuing regarding consideration of an aid package to Ukraine, but said Sunday that “we will send our package.”
The speaker specifically teased that he is contemplating bundling some of that assistance as a loan and tapping into seized Russian assets to fund the weaponry.
Back in February, the Senate passed a $95 billion supplemental package featuring some $14 billion for Israel and $60 billion for Ukraine. Johnson has declined to take that up for consideration. 
Democrats have clamored for him to do so.
“We didn’t need any reminders in terms of what’s going on in Ukraine,” White House national security spokesperson Kirby told NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “But last night certainly underscores significantly the threat that Israel faces in a very, very tough neighborhood.”
“We’re just looking for leadership out of the speaker’s office: get it on the floor, get it voted on so that not only Israel can get additional resources and defend itself — which they clearly need — but that Ukraine can as well,” he said, referring to the supplemental.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.), who has emerged as one of the most prominent defenders of Israel within the Democratic Party, echoed that.
“We’re all in that same fight and we all need to stand with all these democracies. Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan as well, too,” Fetterman said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.
“It’s a disgrace if we don’t deliver this aid.”
President Joe Biden had requested Congress re-up aid to Ukraine back in August of last year, but the House of Representatives dragged its feet, mired by internal GOP bickering.
Republicans had sought to push the Biden administration into making concessions on the border in exchange for aid to Ukraine. However, the GOP later killed a $118 billion supplemental featuring both foreign aid and bolstered bordered security provisions.

Some still want the border addressed in exchange for Ukraine aid. 
“I am prepared to help Ukraine. I want to see us deal with the southern border too,” Rubio said on “State of the Union.” “I hope those two things can happen in conjunction.”
Looming over all of this is the specter of Johnson suffering a mutiny just like his predecessor Kevin McCarthy did last September.
Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has led the charge in threatening a motion to vacate the chair or oust him. She met with Johnson last week and refused to rule out the possibility of pulling the trigger on that motion afterward.
“How much money do the U.S. taxpayers have to pay now after this weekends [sic] Iranian activities? How much money will Zelenskyy get because obviously Ukraine first?” Greene grumbled on X.

Some Democrats have indicated they may toss him a lifeline this time if his ouster is predicated on Ukraine aid, though it’s not entirely clear how many.
Former President Donald Trump also broadly lent Johnson some words of support during their meeting in Mar-a-Lago last Friday, though not on Ukraine specifically.

A former top NATO commander Sunday derided the Biden administration as “timid” for not retaliating more against the Iran-backed terror group the Houthis, who have launched assaults against US warships.
Ex-NATO Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis — who served under President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president — criticized the White House over its handling of the defiant Yemeni rebels as the Israel-Hamas war threatened to spread with Iran’s air assault against Israel on Saturday.
“We have been too timid in our approach and striking back at the Houthis. They are proxies. They are creatures of Iran. We are trying to be very calibrated in our approach, and it’s not working,” said Stavridis, a 69-year-old former naval officer, to WABC 770 AM’s “Cats Roundtable” host John Catsimatidis.

President Biden needs to send a stronger message to America’s foes that it can’t be messed with, a former top NATO chief says. AP

“They are continuing to shoot at our warships. They are shooting at merchant traffic. Sooner or later, one of those ballistic missiles is going to get through, and you’re going to see dozens of American sailors killed, or big merchant ship sunk and environmental disaster or blocking the Suez Canal approaches,” Stavridis said.

The US struck hundreds of Houthi targets during a prolonged campaign earlier this year, but the terror group had been undeterred, killing three crew members of a Liberian-owned, Barbados-flagged bulk carrier just last month as it vowed to ramp up attacks during Ramadan.
On April 3, Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads US Air Forces Central, claimed the American attacks on the militia group have “certainly affected their behavior. Their pace of operations is not what it was.”
But Stavridis insisted that the US response to date is not enough.
“We need to increase the offensive work we’re doing against the Houthis,” he said.

“We’re going to probably have to start thinking about going after Iranian maritime targets to send them a signal to stop supplying these Houthi rebels. We have been too timid thus far in our approach against these pirates.  And that’s what they are. Every nation has an interest in this stopped.”
The Houthis took over vast swaths of Yemen in 2014, sparking a civil war. Their current offensives are aimed at supporting Palestinians during the Israel war after Oct. 7 while generally trying to increase their influence and popularity in the region.
Their ally, Iran, launched a blistering air attack on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a deadly assault on Iranian officials in Syria earlier this month. Still, nearly all of the drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted by Israel in the air.

Published

The Biden administration is being blasted for allowing billions of dollars to allegedly flow into Iran under a controversial sanctions waiver — even after Iranian-backed rebels launched deadly air strikes against American forces and the Muslim country just directly attacked staunch US ally Israel.
Last month, the White House extended the waiver, a move that unlocked up to $10 billion more in frozen funds by enabling Iraq to pay the Iranian government for electricity services, according to critics and the Washington Free Beacon.
The Biden administration had already renewed the waiver program, which was established in 2018, in November. 
The extended waiver was then set to expire again in March, but the administration reapproved it once more — just six weeks after three US service members were killed and dozens more injured in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan in late January.
This past weekend, Iran launched 300 drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an airstrike in Damascus earlier this month.

The State Department has long insisted such waivers are “necessary” while Iraq “weans itself off Iranian energy imports” and develops its domestic oil and gas production. The White House claims the unfrozen funds can only be used for humanitarian purposes.
“None of Iran’s money held in restricted accounts overseas has gone to Iran, and we have not freed up any cash to Iran. Any notion to the contrary is false and misleading.” the State Department told The Post in a statement Sunday. 
“That money is held in restricted accounts overseas with strict oversight and in close coordination between the Departments of Treasury and State.”

		The epic fail of Biden’s doctrine vs. Iran — no consequences	





Asked if plans are in the works to increase pressure on Iran through additional sanctions after Saturday’s missile strike, the State Department said, “We are in ongoing engagement with allies and partners, including at the G7, on ways to increase pressure on Iran, but we cannot preview or detail measures under consideration.”
In a statement to The Post, the White House stood by President Biden’s record on Iran, citing the US military’s efforts in thwarting last night’s attack, as well as imposing “more than 500 sanctions on Iran” since taking office.
“The waiver…which allows for Iraq to import Iranian energy as it works to become energy independent, continues a practice that was started by the Trump administration and has been renewed 21 times since 2018,” the White House said.
“Precisely zero money from this electricity waiver is going to Iran. U.S. sanctions remain in place and are continuing to prevent Iran’s money—whether from its oil sales under previous administrations or its electricity sales to Iraq that occurred—from flowing to Iran.”
“Under these waivers, no money has been permitted to enter Iran,” a State Department official insisted to the Beacon. “These funds, which are held abroad in third countries, can only be used for transactions for the purchase of food, agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, and other non-sanctionable transactions.
“The money goes straight to the trusted vendor or financial institution in another country. The money never touches Iran.”
But some Republican lawmakers say a lack of transparency and accountability has resulted in the funds being used to pay for state-sanctioned terrorist operations in the rogue nation.

Earlier this month, a group of 13 Republican senators led by Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Ranking Member Tim Scott (R-S.C.) wrote a pointed letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for an end to such sanction waivers.
The senators called it “unfathomable” that the Biden administration believes that making the funds potentially available to Iran serves US national security interests.
“If we want to actually restore deterrence in the region, those funds should be placed further out of Iran’s reach, not closer,” the blistering letter said.
On April 9, the committee grilled Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo about the “fungible nature” of the funds, which ostensibly are earmarked exclusively for humanitarian purposes.

Even Adeyemo said it is likely the funds have been used to finance “violent activity” before a cent of them reaches Iranians in need.
“What we’ve seen time and time again from the Iranian regime, is they [Iran] fail to feed their people, and they’ve put the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] first. Any dollar they have will go towards their violent activity before they deal with their people,” Adeyemo testified.
“That’s partially why almost none of the humanitarian money has been used for humanitarian purposes, because they don’t care about getting drugs and food for their people.”

In the wake of the Islamic republic’s missile and drone strike against Israel on Saturday, several of the letter’s signatories Sunday accused the Biden administration of emboldening the regime through its sanctions policies.
“President Biden’s hollow, dithering doctrine of appeasement has not only emboldened Iran, it’s enriched the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told The Post in a statement.
” ‘Don’t’ is not a foreign policy; and it’s certainly not a deterrent,” the senator said, referencing the one-word warning Biden issued ahead of Iran launching its attack.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told The Post that the Biden administration has overseen a flood of cash landing in Iran’s coffers.
“Four years ago, Iran was weak and the ayatollahs were nearly broke. Now thanks to Joe Biden’s sanctions relief and weak policies on Iran, they have enough cash to shoot 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unprecedented attack on our ally,” Cotton claimed.
Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby fended off questions about whether the administration has been tough enough on Iran.

“Look at the sanctions we’ve put in place against Iran, look at the resources we put into the region. It’s hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we’ve somehow go soft on Iran,” Kirby said.
He pointed the finger at former President Trump’s administration for Iran now being “dramatically closer to a potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before Mr. Trump was elected.”
On Saturday night, Iran launched 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles in a mass-scale aerial assault on the Jewish state.
With the help of Israel’s allies, and its advanced “David’s Sling” missile defense system, approximately 99% of the ordinance was intercepted and never hit the ground in Israel.

The Iranian general killed in the Israeli airstrike that triggered Iran’s retaliatory weekend attack was the Muslim country’s point-man on Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a report said Sunday.
The Coalition Council of Islamic Revolution Forces, an organization with close links to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi after his death for his “strategic role in forming and strengthening the resistance front as well as in planning and executing the Al-Aqsa Storm,” a k a the October massacre, according to the Jerusalem Post.
The group’s description of the slain officer April 3, two days after his death, marked the “clearest admission of Iran’s involvement in the atrocities which saw 1,200 mostly civilians murdered and over 250 taken hostage, since terror group Hamas invaded Israel on October 7,” said dissident news organization Iran International.

“This is essentially an official admission by a senior Iranian regime figure that Iran did indeed have a hand in the planning and execution of the October 7 attack,” the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute added.

Khamenei had denied Oct. 10 that Iran was involved in the October slaughter, although a Wall Street Journal report the next day said Tehran clearly had inside knowledge about the attacks, citing key sources within Iran and Hamas.

The airstrike led Iran to launch some 300 missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday night. 
The “vast majority” of the strikes were deflected by Israel, with the help of the US and other allies, officials said.

Iran — which hosted celebratory street rallies with banners supporting Hamas’ invasion on the same day of Oct. 7 massacre — was the site of similar scenes Sunday after Iran’s unsuccessful retaliatory barrage.

House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed to take another swing at passing an aid package to Israel this week in the wake of Iran’s unprecedented attacks against the US ally and dropped some hints about war-torn Ukraine.
“We have understood the urgency of this from the very beginning,” Johnson told Fox News’ “Morning with Maria.” “We passed our Israel support package [last year]. It’s been sitting on Chuck Schumer’s desk ever since, because we included a pay-for, as you remember.
“We’re going to try again this week,” he went on. “And the details of that package are being put together right now. We’re looking at the options on all these supplemental issues.”

Johnson (R-La.) previously pushed through a standalone package for Israel early on in his speakership, but it was never taken up by the Democrat-controlled Senate, whose leadership wanted that support paired with military assistance for Ukraine. Democrats also opposed proposed cuts to the IRS in that bill.

Back in February, the Senate passed a roughly $95 billion supplemental that allocated about $14 billion for Israel and $60 billion to Ukraine, but Johnson declined to take that up for a vote in the House of Representatives.

At the time, he cited concerns about the lack of border security reforms, though Republicans opposed a prior $118 billion supplemental that included provisions aimed at bolstering border security. 
In March, Johnson told The Post that it was important the House didn’t take up Ukraine aid before wrapping up the delicate appropriations process for fiscal year 2024, which Congress finished last month — six months late. 
Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has threatened to spark a motion to oust the speaker — as a warning that she could initiate a mutiny against him if he takes up Ukraine aid. Johnson has already roiled her on government surveillance and appropriations.

Johnson met with Greene last week and then later with Trump on Friday in Mar-a-Lago.
“[Trump’s] introduced the loan-lease concept, which is a really important one that I think has a lot of consensus, as well as these other ideas, the REPO Act, which we have discussed, which is seizing the assets of corrupt Russian oligarchs to help pay for this resistance,” he said.
“We will put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.”

Trump lent Johnson his support, saying it’s “not an easy situation for any speaker” and that ” I think he’s doing a very good job.” The former president also sought to nudge Greene into being more understanding.
“He and I are 100% united on these big agenda items,” Johnson claimed. Green also bashed Johnson for not pushing harder against the Biden administration on border security.
“What Marjorie fails to notice is that we have been fighting on the border. We fight on it every day,” Johnson shot back, before contending that he prioritized averting a government shutdown to avoid the ripple effects on the border. 
“Imagine Border Patrol agents not being paid and those open borders, the responsibility for that being shifted to us. Imagine troops not being paid at this dangerous time. So that simply wasn’t an option for us, it would have reflected badly on us.”
Greene first dangled the motion to vacate just as the House of Representatives was wrapping up the appropriations process last month to stave off a government shutdown. After meeting with the speaker, she kept that option on the table. 
“That’s a distraction. What Marjorie’s done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because, if we don’t grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we’re going to lose the republic,” Johnson warned ominously.

		Sen. John Fetterman says Biden should not rule out US involvement in an Israeli campaign against Iran

										Iran claims to follow drone launch at Israel with ballistic missile barrage									



										White House says US support for Israel is 'ironclad,' will 'support their defense' amid Iran attack									



										Netanyahu not consulted on strike that killed Hamas leader's 3 sons, Israeli media reports									






Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said he didn’t agree with President Biden on his stance that the U.S. wouldn’t join in an offensive operation against Iran during an interview on Sunday, saying he would never “capitulate to the fringe” of his party.
CNN host Jake Tapper asked Fetterman to respond to reports that Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. wouldn’t participate in any offensive operations against Iran during a conversation on Saturday.
“Do you think that’s the right call or should direct U.S. military action, as some of your colleagues in the Senate are suggesting, should that be on the table?” he asked.
“I don’t agree with that, I just think we should follow and have Israel’s back in the situation. I don’t agree with the president. That doesn’t change anything that he‘s a fantastic president. I‘m proud to stand with him and campaign for him and vote for him,” he responded.

Tapper asked Fetterman to respond to Sen. Marco Rubio, who said the fact that the White House was leaking this information about the Biden-Netanyahu conversation was “offensive” to him because it signaled Biden was trying to “appease the far left in his party.”
“The president is entitled to his own views and whatever he decides to do. But I would never capitulate to the fringe. I’ll never pander to that as well. In fact, that empowers Hamas and Hamas, they’re actually convinced they’re winning the PR war. And they’re never going to negotiate at this point. They think that they’re going to hold onto the very end,” Fetterman said.



Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., stated that he does not agree with Biden’s position that he will not be joing Israel in a counter-offensive against Iran. AP
“And I know why they’re not willing to provide any kind of proof of life. And I don’t know why there’s not more of that conversation in the media, like what about the hostages? What’s happened to them? Where are they now? And let’s just bring them home. And then all of the harsh words should be directed at Hamas, which started this. And now continues to hold all of over 100 Israeli hostages,” he continued.
Fetterman argued Hamas could end the war today if they released the hostages.
As Iran launched a large wave of attack drones and missiles toward Israel on Saturday, the Israeli military was tracking and preparing to intercept the weapons in the first-ever direct attack on Israel by the Islamic Republic, the Times of Israel reported.



Despite not joining in the counter-offensive, Biden has promised to continue supporting Israel in other ways. AP
Earlier Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel had for weeks “been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran.”
Netanyahu said Israel’s “air defenses are deployed, we are ready for any scenario, both in attack and in defense,” Fox News Digital reported.
The White House vowed Saturday that the United States’ support for Israel’s security is “ironclad,” pledging to stand with the Jewish state and “support their defense” after Iran launched an aerial drone attack towards the country Saturday afternoon.

Fetterman was also asked in the interview if he was worried Trump could win Pennsylvania. The senator said it would be a close race.
“Trump, of course, he’s very popular here. I‘ve been saying that same thing eight years ago in 2016. And I was concerned and now, I’d like to point out that Joe Biden is the only American that ever beat Trump politically. And he’s going to do it again. And he’s going to carry Pennsylvania. And it‘s going to be close,” Fetterman said.
Fox News’ Stepheny Price and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

Nonplussed Israelis sunbathed and enjoyed outdoor cafes Sunday, hours after Iran’s air assault. 
About 99% of Iran’s drones and missiles were intercepted in the air by Israel with the help of US, Jordan, France and UK forces, leaving little structural damage — although they badly wounded an Arab child when the remnants of a shot-down ballistic missile fell on her family’s home near Arad, officials said.
The strikes — which were retaliation for Israel’s killing of seven Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps fighters and leaders in Syria on April 1 — appeared to have left at least some Israelis relatively unphased, judging from photos published Sunday of people sunbathing in Tel Aviv and enjoying outdoor cafes.

“My husband went for for walk at 8.30, the cafés were open, the beach was open, Debbie Fenton told The Jewish Chronicle from Herzliya. “Everything was back to normal. Israelis are used to it. They’re used to being attacked; it’s normal life for them.”

Jerusalem resident Ayala Salant told Agence France-Presse that the “situation is really frightening” but added, “We are very, very happy with the alliance that helped us because most of the aircraft and missiles have not arrived to Israel.”
Lord David Wolfson shared on social media that his British parents had “no disruption at all” while staying in Jerusalem.

“Apparently there was a siren at 1 a.m., but we both slept through it. With double glazed windows, metal exterior blinds and fabric interior blinds, siren didn’t wake us up,” a message from his mother read.
“All quiet at the moment. Dad has been to the fruit shop. He has a lunchtime appointment at Maccabi to remove wax from his ears. Will get cabs both ways,” she added.
Shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange slipped less than 1% — a “slightly negative but not hysterical” reaction to the anticipated attack, IBI investment house chief economist Rafi Gozlan told the Times of Israel.
Still, many schools in Israel were slated to be closed Monday because of the active security threat, according to the outlet. Some ultra-Orthodox schools opened in defiance of the closures.
Parents of special-needs children attending the closed schools voiced their frustration, as they said they were expected to work despite the school closures.

“It’s so frustrating,” said Yulia Ben Moshe, 54, whose 16-year-old son is wheelchair-bound and dependent on a breathing apparatus, referring to the school closures that left her scrambling to find care.
“We are in a hard situation, but the system needs to plan for this. Every time something happens, families need to deal with it alone,” she said, adding, “This is a continuing problem during emergencies.”
Life was much slower to return to normal in Israel in the days after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack that left more than 1,200 dead.

A little more than six months later, Israel has reportedly killed more than 33,000 Palestinians and left millions more in a humanitarian crisis in its response.

President Biden met with G7 leaders in an emergency session Sunday after reportedly telling Israel that the US would not take part in a counterstrike after Iran’s drone attack — and Iranian and Israeli authorities prepared for their next moves.
“President Biden spoke by secure video with the leaders of the G7 today,” the White House wrote in a post on X above a photo of the commander in chief and his top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the meeting, with other heads of Group of Seven countries appearing on a video screen behind them. 
“The leaders condemned Iran’s unprecedented attack against Israel and reaffirmed the G7’s commitment to Israel’s security,” the post said, referring to the group of leaders from global powerhouses including the US, UK, France and Japan.

Biden also privately spoke with Jordanian King Abdullah II about the “unprecedented” attack, the White House said.

The UN Security Council held an emergency session, too, in which US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood warned, “Let me be clear: If Iran or its proxies take actions against the US or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible.”

UN Secretary Genearl Antonio Guterres pleaded for calm.
“The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate,” he said at the session.
Hawkish Israeli government ministers had reportedly called for an immediate retaliatory strike after Saturday night’s attack on Israel, which saw hundreds of drones and missiles launched into the Jewish nation. Most of the armed drones were intercepted in the air.
But those plans were shelved in favor of more talks — after a phone call between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the New York Times.
Biden warned Netanyahu during the call that the US would not take part in a counterstrike against Iran, a senior administration has said. 
Leaders around the world also swiftly issued statements condemning Iran’s actions but also expressing fears of a further escalation to the hostilities.

Biden also told Bibi “that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks — sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the White House said in a statement.
Israel’s war cabinet was meeting Sunday as the regional war threatened to create further global chaos.
Ahead of the meeting, Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz vowed that his country would take actions it deems appropriate in response to Iran’s aerial onslaught.

“We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” he said.
Biden convened a meeting of the G7 on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” officials said.

But in a saber-rattling statement, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi warned Israel and its allies against undertaking any “reckless behavior” in response to Saturday’s attack, during which approximately 99% of the 300 missiles and suicide drones were swatted down by Israel’s advanced “David’s Sling” air-defense system.
“If the Zionist regime or its supporters demonstrate reckless behaviour, they will receive a decisive and much stronger response,” Raisi said in a statement Sunday.

But Iran may have overextended itself with Saturday night’s opening salvo.
Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, CENTCOM Chief Ret. Gen. Frank McKenzie said Iran’s attack “was close to a maximum effort as they could generate,” adding, “Iran could not replicate last night’s attack tonight if they had to…Iran is relatively weaker than it was yesterday.”
The US has not identified any credible threats to its own security at the moment, a Biden administration official told CNN.
Speaking on “Good Morning America” on Sunday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Israel “demonstrated a superior military capability” in fending off the airstrike but expressed concerns that their response could lead to the conflict spreading.

“We don’t want to see the situation escalate further, we’re not looking for a war with Iran,” Kirby said.
According to the Israel Defense Forces, Israel, along with its allies, thwarted Iran’s attack that included 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles with an approximately 99% interception rate.

		Oil prices expected to rise after Iran’s attack on Israel, but further gains may depend on response

Oil prices are expected to rise on Monday after Iran’s attack on Israel over the weekend, analysts said on Sunday, but further gains may depend on how Israel and the West choose to retaliate.
Iran launched explosive drones and missiles at Israel late on Saturday in retaliation for a suspected Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria on April 1, a first direct attack on Israeli territory that has stoked fears of a wider regional conflict.
Concern of a response from Iran to the strike on its embassy compound in Damascus supported oil last week and helped send global benchmark Brent crude on Friday to $92.18 a barrel, the highest since October.

It settled that day up 71 cents at $90.45, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude futures rose 64 cents to $85.66. Trading is closed on Sunday.

“It is only reasonable to expect stronger prices when trading resumes,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. “Having said that, there has been no impact on production so far and Iran has said that ‘the matter can be deemed concluded’.
“However fierce and painful the initial market reaction will be, the rally could prove to be short-lived unless supply from the region is materially disrupted.”

U.S. President Joe Biden said he would convene a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven major economies on Sunday to coordinate a diplomatic response to the Iranian attack.
“Oil prices might spike at the opening as this is the first time Iran has struck Israel from its territory,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.
“How long any bounce will last will… depend on the Israeli response,” Staunovo added. “Also today’s G7 virtual meeting needs to be monitored, with an eye on if they target or not Iranian crude exports.”

Iran has steeply raised oil exports – its main sources of revenue – under the Joe Biden administration. Exports were severely reduced under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, who will face Biden in a presidential election rematch in November.
The Biden administration has argued it is not encouraging Iran to raise exports and is enforcing sanctions.
Lower Iranian exports would lead to a further rise in oil prices and the cost of gasoline in the U.S., a politically sensitive subject ahead of the elections.

Another factor to watch will be any impact on shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the volume of the world’s total oil consumption passes daily.
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s navy said on Tuesday Tehran could close the strait if deemed necessary, and earlier on Saturday, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported a Guards helicopter had boarded and taken into Iranian waters a vessel, the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries.
“Crude prices already included a risk premium, and the extent to which it will widen further almost exclusively depends on developments near Iran around the Strait of Hormuz,” said Ole Hansen at Saxo Bank.

A Chicago politician was slammed by the Israeli consulate after she appeared to cheer Iran’s attack on Israel with a pro-Palestinian post — but later claimed she hadn’t seen the latest news when she made the post. 
Rossana Rodriguez, a councilwoman representing Chicago’s 33rd ward, posted “Free Palestine,” just hours after news began rolling in about Iran’s rocket attack Saturday on Israel.
Rodriguez, who has been outspoken about accusing Israel of genocide and demanding a ceasefire since the war in Gaza started following Hamas’ October 7 attack, quickly began facing flack over the post.

We condemn in the strongest terms this Chicago Alderwoman's celebration of Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel.This is the same Alderwoman behind the highly controversial ""ceasefire"" resolution.We see a pattern – not aiming for peace, but for Israel's destruction.We hope… pic.twitter.com/GQPpqhWX2R— Israel in Chicago (@IsraelinChicago) April 13, 2024

“We condemn in the strongest terms this Chicago Alderwoman’s celebration of Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel,” the Israeli consulate in the Windy City posted on X.

“This is the same Alderwoman behind the highly controversial ‘ceasefire’ resolution. We see a pattern – not aiming for peace, but for Israel’s destruction.”

Another commenter said: “Can you please discuss the timing of this tweet? I thought you wanted a ceasefire?”
“Very interesting to see the “ceasefire now” crowd celebrate the escalation of the conflict into a regional war,” said another.

Several hours later Rodriguez defended the timing of her post, claiming she’d just gotten off a flight and hadn’t seen the news when she made the post.
“I had just watched a video of Gaza with a father sobbing holding his dead child. This moment is immensely tragic and it’s sad that there’s people choosing to create so much more hate,” she wrote.
“I’ve been saying Free Palestine for decades & specially the last few months. I do not celebrate war or the loss of human life in any way,” she added, calling her critics the “same people who have been cheering on a genocide.”

The post came hours after Iran’s missile and suicide drone attack on Israel. X / @RossanaFor33
Rodriguez’s office didn’t immediately respond to request for comment Sunday.
Iran launched a barrage of about 300 suicide drones and missiles at the Jewish state on Saturday night — but miraculously, nearly all the weapons were shot down but defensive systems, according to Israeli media.
Only one casualty — a 7-year-old Bedouin girl — has been identified so far.

The missiles were launched from Iran, with Israeli air defenses — with the help of US , French, and UK ships and warplanes — shooting them out of the sky.

Fighter jets from Jordan also assisted, though the middle eastern country claimed it was not helping Israel but rather defending its own air space.

							AP						




Critics quickly pummeled President Biden over his response to the unprecedented escalation from Iran against Israel, blasting him for not addressing the public right away and being more supportive of the US ally. 
Biden, 81 pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against carrying out a retaliatory attack against Tehran amid fears of such actions spiraling into a larger war, according to multiple reports. 
This particularly animated his critics.

“I don’t agree with that,” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I just think we should follow and have Israel’s back in the situation.”

“I don’t agree with the president. That doesn’t change anything that he’s a fantastic president, and I’m proud to stand with him and campaign for him and vote for him.”

Fetterman stressed that Biden is “entitled to his own views” but he insisted “I would never capitulate to the fringe.”
Like Biden, Fetterman has faced severe blowback from progressives for his support of Israel in its war against Hamas. Fetterman, however, has been unabashed about his pro-Israel stance.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) accused the administration of leaking Biden’s discussion with Netanyahu to the press in order to further pressure Israel against retaliation.

“Why would the White House leak it? There’s only one reason they leaked that, and that is that so when Israel does respond, the White House can say we told them not to do it,” Rubio told CNN.
Rubio further accused the White House of trying to “appease” his “far-left” base.
Former President Donald Trump’s ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton also recoiled at reports that Biden nudged Netanyahu against striking back at Iran.

“If Joe Biden as some press reports, have it, is urging the Israelis not to retaliate at all, he is an embarrassment to the United States,” Bolton told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“This is in America’s interest to make sure that Iran, which is the principal threat to international peace and security in the region, is at a minimum put in its place.”

The White House pushed back at criticism over Biden’s response and anyone questioning his commitment to Israel.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was coy about what Biden told Netanyahu during their call on Saturday in the wake of the salvo of Iranian attacks barrelling toward the Jewish state.
“The president has been a man of his word. He said we’re going to help Israel defend itself, and we’ve been doing that,” Kirby told CNN when asked if Biden was against Israel retaliating

Kirby also pointed out that the US intercepted dozens of drones and missiles before they reached Israeli airspace.
Kirby also shrugged off Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky) call on Biden to “match words with actions.”
“I don’t know how you can look at what happened and say that he hasn’t,” Kirby said.

The president also weathered blowback for his decision not to deliver public remarks on Saturday.
Biden, 81, had cut short his weekend beach trip to Delaware Saturday and bolted back to the White House ahead of the widely anticipated attack from Iran against Israel over the strike that killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi and deputy Gen. Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi earlier this month.
But not long after hundreds of Iranian missiles and explosive drones barreled toward Israel, the White House announced that Biden would have no more public events, and the president declined to deliver public remarks. 

As the American people watch in horror as Israel faces unprecedented attacks from Iran, Joe Biden and the White House shamefully called a lid and refused to address the nation and the world. Their silence is deafening. On the contrary, President Trump is scheduled to speak to…— Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) April 13, 2024

The announcement — “calling a lid,” in Beltway jargon — was made just after 5 p.m. Saturday. 
Behind the scenes, Biden directed the US response, holding a call with Netanyahu to congratulate him on an “incredible military achievement” by fending off the garage of Iranian attacks, according to Kirby.

The president also later put out a statement to “condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms,” directed the military to assist in the downing of Iranian weaponry, and announced plans to convene an emergency meeting of the Group of 7 leaders. 
Prominent Republicans and conservatives weren’t pleased.

I don’t care what political party you belong to, I think we can all agree that the leader of the free world should project strength, clarity and conviction.Biden couldn’t even speak yesterday as a major conflict that could lead to a world war broke out.We didn’t hear from him…— Joey Mannarino (@JoeyMannarinoUS) April 14, 2024

“Joe Biden and the White House shamefully called a lid and refused to address the nation and the world. Their silence is deafening,” House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said.
“On the contrary, President Trump is scheduled to speak to the American people in PA where I am certain he will make unequivocally clear that America stands with Israel and condemn Iran’s heinous attacks,” she added, referencing the former president’s planned rally in Pennsylvania Saturday.
“I don’t care what political party you belong to, I think we can all agree that the leader of the free world should project strength, clarity and conviction,” conservative commentator Joey Mannarino said.

If a Republican president went to his vacation home for the weekend knowing an attack on a major ally was all but certain, the mainstream media would be apoplectic and torching him as rudderless.But because it's a Democrat in Joe Biden, they won't speak up. They're cowards.— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) April 13, 2024

“Biden couldn’t even speak yesterday as a major conflict that could lead to a world war broke out. We didn’t hear from him at all. Any other President would have been out front and center leading the way and telling Iran to cut it out.”
“If a Republican president went to his vacation home for the weekend knowing an attack on a major ally was all but certain, the mainstream media would be apoplectic and torching him as rudderless,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck chided.
“But because it’s a Democrat in Joe Biden, they won’t speak up.”

Biden is weak and has dementia. Our adversaries do not respect us. This is the result. https://t.co/Fjq2Vesfo5— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) April 13, 2024

“Biden is weak and has dementia. Our adversaries do not respect us. This is the result,” OutKick founder Clay Travis said. 
Trump, 77, who presided over an escalation with Iran after he ordered a strike to kill Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, knocked his successor.

Iran carried out retaliatory strikes near US assets in the region afterward and Trump kept his powder dry in response.
“I want to say God bless the people of Israel — they’re under attack right now,” Trump declared at a Saturday rally in Schnecksville, Penn. “That’s because we show great weakness.”
“It would not have happened if we were in office.”

A plurality of Americans want President Biden to begin taking a tougher stance on Israel and want a cease-fire in the war against Hamas, a new poll found prior to Iran’s attack.
Thirty-four percent of respondents felt that Biden is “not tough enough” on Israel, while 17% felt he is too tough, 26% believe he is handling it just right, and 24% aren’t sure, per a Politico-Morning Consult poll.
Although taken before Tehran’s unprecedented military strike against Israel Saturday, the poll sheds light on the thorny politics Biden is grappling with domestically on Israel.

A plurality of voters want President Biden to toughen up on Israel, according to a new poll. AP
Democrats in particular were most likely to want Biden to toughen up on the critical US ally in the Middle East, with 33% feeling he is “not tough enough on Israel,” compared to 12% of Republicans and 19% of Independents.

A paltry 8% of Democrats felt Biden was “too tough” and 42% said that the president’s handling of the situation was “just right.”
Additionally, among the public writ large, 47% strongly support the US calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, while 20% somewhat support that call, 15% somewhat or strongly oppose it, and 17% are unsure.

Biden, 81, pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut a deal with Hamas for a cease-fire in exchange for hostages earlier this month. He wants a pause in fighting to send critical humanitarian aid to Gaza.
However, negotiations have repeatedly stalled amid heightened concerns over how many hostages are still alive. 
Still, despite the quibbling over how supportive of Israel Biden should be, a plurality of Americans favor the Israelis in the conflict, the survey revealed.

When asked about whom they were more sympathetic toward, 29% of respondents said Israel, 14% the Palestinians, 37% equally both sides, and 20% said they don’t know. 
Among Democrats, 22% were more sympathetic toward the Palestinians, 16% the Israelis, while 44% said both.

Meanwhile, Republicans sided with the Israelis over the Palestinians by a 45% to 7% margin, while Independents hewed that way 25% to 13%.
On whether the US should cut off aid to Israel, 41% of Democrats support doing so while 33% were opposed, compared to 33% of Americans overall in favor of cutting off aid and 44% in opposition.

That poll was conducted from April 5 to 7 among 6,004 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point for the overall group surveyed. 
Separately, a CBS YouGov poll found a growing number of Americans want Biden to push Israel to ease up its military campaign in the war against Hamas.

When asked about what Biden should encourage Israel to do, 37% said cease military actions and 23% said decrease military actions; surpassing the 28% who want Biden to push Israel to maintain the current level of action and 12% who want an increase. 
That’s an uptick from the 31% who want Biden to push for a stop to its military actions and 24% who want a decrease in military actions; compared to the 32% who want Biden to push Israel to keep up the same level of actions and 13% who want an increase back in February.

In terms of sympathies, 32% said they sympathize “a lot” with the Israelis, while 46% said the same about the Palestinians.
That’s a sharp reversal from October, when 44% said their sympathies lie with the Israelis and 39% with the Palestinians, according to the CBS poll. 
Like Politico, the CBS poll was conducted prior to Iran’s historically unprecedented strike against Israel.

President Biden is facing intense pressure from his base over the Israel-Hamas war. AP
When presented with the hypothetical of Iran attacking Israel, 25% backed military action against Iran, 42% wanted the US to support Israel’s actions without getting involved militarily, and 32% wanted the US to stay out of it. 
The CBS poll was taken from April 9 to 12 among 2,399 adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan on Sunday described how he was forced to take shelter in Bethlehem during Iran’s attack on Israel — hours before meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank.
“This Sunday in Bethlehem all does seem calm and bright. And it is for us. We feel safe and secure. That wasn’t true in the middle of last night when the air raid sirens went off, and we had to go down and seek security at Notre Dame Center.” the New York cardinal said in a video shared on X, referencing the Christmas song “Silent Night.”

He later met with Abbas in the presidential headquarters in Ramallah, about 6 miles north of Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.

During their meeting, Abbas told the cardinal that he appreciated the Church’s “positions calling for stopping the Israeli aggression and achieving peace and stability in the Holy Lands and the world,” the outlet said.  
Dolan, in return, reportedly conveyed the pope’s greetings and praised Abbas’s “role and wise leadership in enabling the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights supported by the Catholic Church,” according to WAFA.

Dolan is set to remain in Israel and Palestinian-controlled territories through Thursday as part of his role as chair of the Catholic Near East Welfare Association, according to an earlier press release.
He is meeting with local Christian, Jewish and Islamic religious leaders — as well as hopefully spending time with the families of hostages, the statement said.

Dolan also noted in his statement that he’ll “enjoy a Sabbath meal with Jewish friends and visit with Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups.”

His visit comes as Iran launched a slew of deadly drones at Israel on Saturday evening that killed a 7-year-old Bedouin girl.
The move comes in retaliation after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
In Sunday’s video, Dolan notes before the attack Saturday night that he visited the Creche — a center in Bethlehem run by nuns who take in abandoned babies.
 “Those are messages of inspiration that you get here in the Holy Land that I think have given the people the resilience and hope for which they are famous. Happy Sunday,” Dolan said, concluding the video.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the outcome was a “very significant strategic success” and President Biden said the US helped its ally down “nearly all” of the airstrikes.

Russia said on Sunday it was extremely concerned by Iranian strikes on Israel and called on all parties to exercise restraint but said tensions would remain high until the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was resolved.
“We express our extreme concern over another dangerous escalation in the region,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the Iranian attacks. “We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint.”
Russia noted that Tehran had said the attack was made within the right to self-defense after Israel’s strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that Moscow condemned.

Russia, which has close ties to Iran, said that the West had blocked attempts in the United Nations Security Council to respond to the Israeli strike on the consulate.

The Kremlin has yet to comment publicly.

President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister that nothing of “value” was hit in Iran’s airborne attack Saturday and asserted American forces will not be participating in any offensive against Iran, according to a report.
The president called Israel’s defense during the attacks a win — telling Netanyahu Israel’s ability to intercept nearly all of the hundreds of missiles and drones showed its military superiority, a US official told CNN. 
Biden also made it very clear that the US would not be engaging in any military offensive against the Islamic Republic, the senior official told the channel
Israeli Defense Forces said it had shot down the “vast majority” of projectiles outside of Israel’s borders. It was assisted by the US military.

“At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night after his phone call with the Israeli leader, according to readout of the call released by the White House.
“Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” he added.

A handful of missiles made it through, with one striking an Israeli base, but damages were minor and no injuries were reported, according to IDF officials.
A senior US official told CNN that the US forces intercepted more than 70 drones and at least three ballistic missiles. The missiles were shot down by two guided missile destroyers deployed in the eastern Mediterranean.
US fighter jets also helped defend Israel from the barrage, another official told the outlet.

Biden said he will meet with G7 leaders on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.”
“While we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” the president said.

Jewish New Yorkers were shocked and outraged by Iran’s missile attack on Israel Saturday, leaving many fearing for their loved ones trapped in the besieged Jewish State.
“Of course, I’m scared for my family and their well-being,” Chaim Goldstein told The Post as he left Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters in Crown Heights.
The Post broke the news of the invasion to dozens of worshippers who had not heard what happened because of Sabbath restrictions.

One man sprinted across the busy Eastern Parkway upon hearing the news so he could check on his family in Israel.

A police presence was stationed outside the synagogue as a precaution.

“I just pray that Hashem should take care of the Jewish people and that the hostages should be allowed to return to their home,” Rabbi David Sholom Pape, 79, told The Post, describing Iran’s attack as a “suicide mission.”
““This is obviously something that could involve the whole world. If they’re stupid enough to do that, they’d commit suicide. They promised they’d do such and such so they had to do something or they’re just straw men. It may just be for show.”

Despite having no knowledge of the escalation, several were unsurprised upon learning that Iran deployed hundreds of suicide drones, ballistic missiles and rockets at the Jewish state in a middle-of-the-night attack.
The strike with some 200 drones marks Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel and comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.

“I’m not surprised but it’s getting serious,” 26-year-old Samson said, noting that his entire family lives in Israel.
“We call every day to find out how they’re doing. We pray every day for our brothers and sisters in their holy land.”
Samson, who declined to provide his last name, chastised the Iranians in Tehran who were seen in photographs celebrating the destruction.
“It’s horrible,” he said. “Celebrating genocide is horrible.”

“We don’t dance around when there are missiles dropping everywhere.  War is terrible. War is cruel. We want the war to stop. Anyone dancing anywhere for missiles dropping is cruel.”
Moshe Frank, 38, agreed — claiming that the Iranian people have been “brainwashed to hate Israel.”
“I’m not sure what they’re celebrating about,” the Brooklynite said. “I hope there’s no more escalation.”

Goldstein, 18, moved to Crown Heights from Israel for school in September — just one month before Hamas launched its Oct. 7 surprise attack that kickstarted the Middle Eastern war.
With his mother’s family still living in Israel, Goldstein pushed for peace and for the conflict over the Jewish State to end.
“I think they also believe it should stop, the missiles and the war,” he said of his family. “We should live in peace together, just like the Arabs and Jews lived in peace,” he said.

In spite of the destruction, Rabbi Shimmy Weinbaum, 49, stressed that God would save the people of Israel — just as he had when Iraq initiated a missile campaign against Israel in 1991.
“The same God who protected us then is still around. He didn’t go anywhere and he will protect us,” Weinbaum said.
The rabbi’s 18-year-old daughter had coincidentally traveled from Israel to Crown Heights to celebrate Passover with her father.

The move marks Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel and comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.

Weinbaum appeared unafraid about the prospect of her return, stating that he feels “like she’s more protected in Israel than she is here.”

Mayor Eric Adams emphasized that New York City “unequivocally stands with the State of Israel” as it faces fresh attacks from Iran.
“As mayor of the largest Jewish population in the world outside of Israel, the significance of this attack for Jewish New Yorkers — many of whom have family in Israel right now — is not lost on me, especially less than 10 days before Passover begins,” Hizzoner said in a statement.
“While there is no direct or imminent threat to New York City at this time, we have directed the NYPD to deploy additional resources to Jewish communities and houses of worship citywide out of abundance of caution to ensure that our communities have the resources they need to feel safe.”
Jewish leaders across New York took to social media to condemn the offense Saturday, including Sen. Chuck Schumer.

“As Israel is under attack from Iran, we stand with Israel and its people, and the United States will do everything we can to support Israel’s defense against Iran,” Schumer said on X.
Mark Treyger, south Brooklyn’s former Democratic city councilmember and Jewish caucus member, said the attack on the Jewish state was a “sobering reminder” of Israel’s suffering since the outbreak of the war on Oct. 7.

“Through proxies, the Iranian unelected, autocratic, regime attacks Israeli civilian populations (Christians, Jews, and Muslims) almost every single day, including contributing to the October 7th massacre via their support for Hamas,” he tweeted. 
“Tonight, the autocratic regime launched an unprecedented and significant direct attack on a U.S. ally and the only democracy in the region. Very thankful for the United States’ armed forces support for our ally in this turning point moment in world history.”

					Iran's leader Ali Khamenei launched a direct attack Saturday against Israel.						
							ZUMAPRESS.com						




After years of using its terrorist proxies to strike Israelis, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei launched a direct attack Saturday against the Jewish state. More than 200 kamikaze drones, weaponized drones and ballistic and cruise missiles were fired from Iranian soil as well as from proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, as Israel and the United States mobilized military assets to intercept them before they struck their targets.
For Iran’s normally cautious supreme leader, this was a risky step. By crossing a red line of a direct attack against Israel from Iranian soil, he opened the door for Jerusalem to hit back hard.
Potential targets include leadership and military assets inside Iran, oil refineries, which are the lifeblood of his regime, and his rapidly expanding nuclear weapons program.
Khamenei may have thought he had little choice. In a daring April 1 operation, the Israeli Air Force killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who played a central role in the planning and execution of Iran’s proxy Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. That savage strike killed 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, including more than 30 Americans, and led to the kidnapping of more than 240 hostages. The IAF killed Zahedi, another top IRGC general and five other IRGC commanders who were planning operations in an IRGC-Quds Force building adjacent to Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria.
Trained terrorists
Zahedi was a big fish. He led the IRGC’s operations out of Syria and, as the main Iranian contact with Lebanese Hezbollah, had helped arm and train Iran’s most dangerous terrorist army.

Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with the Israel Defense Forces for the past six months and possesses more than 175,000 missiles, rockets and mortars including deadly precision-guided munitions that could do devastating damage to Israeli civilian infrastructure.



A map detailing Iran and its proxies strike on Israel.
Not for nothing did Israel see the killing of Zahedi as the most consequential since the Trump administration — with detailed intelligence provided by Israel’s Mossad spy agency — killed Qassem Soleimani, the feared IRGC Quds Force commander, who had waged war against the United States and Israel for decades.
Khamenei took no heed of the Friday warning from President Biden, who told the Iranians “Don’t!” when asked what his response would be to an Iranian attack. The president had dispatched US Central Command Gen. Michael Kurilla to Israel to meet with his IDF counterparts and sent a US warship up the Red Sea. None of this seemed sufficient to deter an Iranian attack though it may have mitigated its severity.

Follow along for live updates on Iran’s attack on Israel 

Now the Biden administration must do more by providing Israel with ballistic-missile-defense support as the two forces have practiced for decades. Washington also should provide all the military supplies the IDF needs to respond to this aggression and unwavering political support to see Israel through this critical time.
Biden’s wavering support for Israel in its war against Hamas, and the threat from dozens of Democratic members of Congress to cut off military support, surely emboldened Khamenei.

Israel is a formidable military power with extensive military assets. It has a multilayered air-defense system that can shoot down drones and cruise and ballistic missiles. But the IDF cannot only play defense. It will be under pressure to respond directly to Iranian aggression with its powerful air, naval and cyber capabilities. If not, this could normalize Iranian direct attacks against Israel. This may also be an opportunity to attack assets connected to Iran’s rapidly expanding nuclear-weapons program.
The Islamic Republic has been at war with Israel for decades. But Iran’s supreme leader now has crossed an Israeli red line that he may come to regret.

A Middle East expert warned that Iran’s aerial strike targeting Israel has the potential to drag Jerusalem into a multi-front war.
“Everyone is talking about Iran, but what’s Hezbollah going to do?” Bruce Hoffman, a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, told The Post, referring to the southern Lebanon-based terror group.
“Israel could face attacks on two fronts.”
A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies warned that with Hezbollah, Israel would face a “far more formidable” enemy than the Palestinian terror group Hamas, whom the Jewish state has been engaged in a six-month war following the Oct. 7 attacks.

One major concern is Hezbollah’s arsenal of more than 130,000 rockets and missiles, which have a range covering all of Israel, that the terror group has received from Iran, Hoffman noted.
“The only reason [Hezbollah] has a missile arsenal provided by Iran is for this eventuality: If Iran is attacked by Israel, Hezbollah would exact terrible retaliation.”

Iran launched its first-ever attack on Israel Saturday, with approximately 500 drones and missiles coming from the Islamic Republic, according to US officials.

In response to attack, Iranians went to the streets to celebrate.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the country while the country was preparing for a direct attack.

He said the Jewish state will respond accordingly.
“Our defense systems are deployed, and we are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense. The State of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, the public is strong.”

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group — the former and possibly future president’s eponymous social-media company — have lost around half their value since going public last month. 
It’s easy to see why: Massive operating losses — and let’s face it, aside from Trump himself, just who really uses its Truth ­Social social-media product? 
User traffic on the platform is just a small fraction of its major competitor X (formerly known as Twitter, whose owner Elon Musk continues to pull out his hair trying to figure out how to make his baby profitable nearly two years after taking it private). 
And yet with all the selling, Trump Media shares aren’t worth zero — far from it in fact (it closed Friday at $32.59, down from its high of $79.38). 

So someone must be buying the stock that trades under the symbol “DJT,” which in case you don’t know, are the initials for the one-and-only, Donald J. Trump.

The question is, who is crazy enough to throw money at a business that reported big losses, is warning of potential insolvency, and offers investors a stock likely to fall a lot further? 
It’s a question I’ve been posing to my friends in the market-making business (people who match buyers and sellers of stock), and some random traders, and the answers aren’t that crazy if you understand how markets work, and how they’ve evolved in recent years. 
Some of the buying is irrational, and some of it makes all the sense in the world if you work at a major trading desk and are willing to roll the dice to make a quick buck. 
Let’s start with the irrational. 
The most natural buyers are the true believers — so-called meme investors who flooded the markets in recent years — and now see DJT (despite its suspect business model) as their next get-rich-quick scheme. 
Meme investors are indeed an odd bunch. 
They seem to think stock prices never go down and that tapping into a social-media “meme” — like a company backed by a celebrity ex-president who is fighting off multiple indictments yet remains ahead in the polls — will make them a fortune. 
Yes, we’ve seen this before. 
Recall how a couple of years ago first-time investors flocked to shares of GameStop, trading under the symbol GME, and AMC Theatres, thinking they found gold in beaten-down shares of financially troubled companies. 
Initially they made some money as they bid up share prices, though many were part of the HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) social-media investing craze who thought that via some magic, these companies would suddenly transform themselves into the next Apple or Amazon. 
Cold hard reality 
They didn’t of course. 
GME hit some highs, and traders who shorted the stock (betting it would fall) initially got crushed, but soon enough, reality set in. 
Same with AMC. 
GME now is down more than 50% over the past year and AMC more than 90%. 
And after factoring in its reverse split, its stock is worth just about 27 cents to long-time holders. 
Shorts eventually made a fortune. 
The meme scenario is playing out once again in the trading of DJT, and that accounts for the other buyers of DJT: stock lenders. 
DJT is a perfect short for reasons outlined above. But the process of short selling involves borrowing shares for a fee, holding them, and hopefully making money by replacing the borrow when shares decline.
Yet to short something, you must find shares to borrow, aka someone to lend them to you. 
After the initial meme rally, there was plenty of AMC and GME in circulation.

DJT shares are pretty scarce, I am told, because insiders like Trump can’t sell for six months thanks to lockups that kick in after a public offering. 
The float is far less than half of DJT’s outstanding shares, so it costs a lot of money to borrow the stock. 
The financial-data firm S3 Partners says DJT is among the most expensive stocks to borrow in the market. 
In other words, there’s some money to be made in lending the stock, and that accounts for the other set of DJT’s buyers in recent weeks, traders tell me. 
Of course, this is all tricky business; any trader who is lending stock owns it, so he needs to hedge by shorting other shares. 
Even so, if prices of DJT decline significantly and the hedges don’t work out, that might cost him more money than what he’s earning from lending fees. 
But stock trading isn’t for the faint of heart. 
There are lots of reasons why people buy something and, given the intricacies of the market, there are lots of ways they can earn a dollar from spending a dime. 
Iran and the Fed 
The latest inflation numbers might stop the Fed from cutting rates in June, though a bigger concern for those banking on the return of easy money might be what’s coming out of the Middle East. 
Wall Street traders told me late last week the word they were getting from government sources was that an Iranian response to Israel’s missile strike on Iran’s Syrian embassy was imminent. And Iranian drone attacks were underway as this column went to press. If the situation escalates, watch oil prices soar, inflation spike —  and forget about rate cuts for the foreseeable future.
If the situation escalates, watch oil prices soar, inflation spike — and forget about rate cuts for the foreseeable future. 

Unrest and war, particularly in the Middle East, is never a good thing, but the volatility of this one could be immense given the economic stakes of higher oil prices. 
Not only will the Fed’s rate-cut plans be shattered, the economy could take a nosedive, upending the 2024 presidential race. 
So stay tuned.

Iran launched a volley of drones and missiles at Israel that are expected to strike the Jewish homeland in several hours, according to US and Israeli officials.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told CNN that GPS will not be available in some areas to track the drones as they prepare defenses against the imminent attack.
Iran has a massive arsenal of its deadly ‘suicide” drone, the Shahed 136.
Unverified footage posted on social media by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-linked accounts purportedly shows the buzzing sound of Shahed drones flying over Iraq.

Iran sold thousands of these weapons to Russia that were subsequently used against targets in the Ukraine, according to Haaretz. 
Iran has also provided them to Houthi rebels in Yemen.
The kamikaze drones have a range of more than 1,500 miles and can carry 80-pound warheads, according to ArmyTechnology.com.

Iran said in August it had built an advanced drone, the Mohajer-10, with an operational range of 1,240 miles, The Times of Israel reported.
They are capable of flying for up to 24 hours with loads as large as 660 pounds.
The IDF said it is tracking at least 100 drones.

Iran also also launched cruise missiles at Israel, according to Israeli media reports.
Iran is armed with the largest number of ballistic missiles in the region, according to the US Office of the Director or National Intelligence, The Times of Israel reported.

The semi-official Iranian news outlet ISNA published a graphic this week revealing the nine Iranian missiles that could reach Israel, according to the outlet.These included the ‘Sejil’, capable of flying at more than 10,500 miles per hour and with a range of 1,550 miles, the ‘Kheibar’ with a range of 1,240 miles, and the ‘Haj Qasem’, which has a range of 870 miles ISNA said.

Israel has a number of layers of air defense capable of intercepting everything from long-range missiles to UAV’s and short-range rockets. 
Hagari said Israel has an “excellent air defense system” but stressed it is not 100% effective and urged the public to listen to safety announcements.
US officials said they will attempt to intercept launches at Israel if possible, CNN reported.

Iran is prepared to retaliate if Israel launches a counter-attack following drone and missile strikes on Saturday, Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,” Iravani wrote in a letter to UN leadership on Saturday, according to Newsweek.
Iravani explained that Iran “does not seek escalation or conflict in the region” and that the drone attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Damascus, Syria, on April 1, which killed two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commanders, including Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi.




“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,” Iraveni said.

“Should the Israeli regime commit any military aggression again, Iran’s response will assuredly and decisively be stronger and more resolute.”

Meanwhile, a 7-year-old Israeli girl from Southern Israel has been severely injured by Iran’s drone and missile onslaught on the Jewish state, per Israel’s emergency service.
The girl is being treated for her injuries by medics from the Magen David ambulance services after she was struck by shrapnel.
The MDA said in a statement that the child suffered a head injury and was rendered unconscious.
Iran has launched a wave of hundreds of drones, as well as cruise missiles at Israel.
The move comes after the Jewish state killed top Iranian generals in a strike on Lebanon on April 1.
Israel has instituted restrictions on civilian activity in response to the strike.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “We are prepared for any scenario.”

Israel shot down the “vast majority” of drones and missiles shot at them by Iran after the Jewish state was attacked in a vicious Saturday barrage, officials said.
Iran launched some 300 drones and missiles from within the Islamic Republic — as well as from proxies in Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon.
The “vast majority” of the missiles were intercepted outside of Israeli air space, the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement.

The United States came to Israel’s aid and shot down some 70 drones and three ballistic missiles. 
Little damage was reported. One Israeli military base suffered minor damage and one child was hurt by drone shrapnel.

								Hooray for Israel! Now Biden should back Israel’s  response vs. Iran — no ifs, ands or buts							










Nothing of “value” was hit in Israel, President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CNN reported, citing White House sources. 
“We intercepted, we repelled, together we shall win,” Netanyahu posted on X early Sunday.
Israel Defense Forces Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told The Associated Press, meanwhile: “A wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation.”

When asked whether Israel would respond, Hagari responded that the army “does and will do whatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel.”
A few missiles managed to get through Israeli defenses, he said. Israeli emergency officials confirmed that one strike critically wounded a 7-year-old girl in southern Israel.
But there were no casualties as a direct result of the Iranian strike, according to Magen David Adom [MDA], Israel’s emergency service agency.
Earlier, MDA said a 7-year-old girl was severely injured in southern Israel by shrapnel from an interceptor missile during Iran’s attack.

The agency said it responded to 31 people who were injured seeking shelter or suffering from anxiety.
Another missile struck an army base, causing some damage but no injuries were reported, Hagari said.
US military forces shot down an undisclosed number of Iranian drones, according to officials.
“In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, US forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched drones targeting Israel,” the official told CNN.
Hours after Iran’s attack, the IDF’s Home Front command told Israelis nationwide no longer need to stay near protected rooms — but that restrictions on gatherings announced earlier would remain in effect, The Times of Israel reported. All educational activities have also been canceled.

Iran’s mission to the United Nations suggested in a statement that the retaliatory strikes may be over — and warned the US to stay out of any engagements between Iran and Israel.
“The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe.
It is Iran’s first-ever direct attack on Israel, and photos emerged Saturday night of Iranians celebrating in Tehran.  
The attacks followed weeks of threats from Tehran after the assassination in Damascus of a top Islamic Revolutionary Guard general that has been widely blamed on Israel.

Jordan’s air force intercepted and shot down dozens of Iranian drones that violated its airspace and were heading to Israel, two regional security sources told Reuters.
The United Kingdom has reportedly not deployed any military resources to intercept Iranian drones but was providing backfill for US assets that have been redeployed after Iran’s attack, CNN reported.
Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group, announced they fired dozens of rockets from southern Lebanon toward Israel.

Israeli officials said they believe the attacks were aimed primarily at Israeli military targets. US officials told CNN that American forces were not targeted.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement after the drones were launched, declaring, “The malicious Zionist regime will be punished.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation shortly before the attacks and said the country was prepared for a direct attack and will respond accordingly.
“Citizens of Israel, in recent years, and even more so in recent weeks, Israel has been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran,” Netanyahu said.





“Our defense systems are deployed, and we are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense,” he declared. “The State of Israel is strong, the IDF is strong, the public is strong.”
Iran says it will not hesitate to take further “defensive measures” to protect its interests against any military aggression, the Iranian foreign ministry says in a statement.
“Iran, if necessary, will not hesitate to take further defensive measures to safeguard its legitimate interests against any military aggressions and unlawful use of force,” it says, according to state TV, “while reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has addressed the nation. 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned “the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran this evening.”
“I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war,” he said in a statement.

Footage showing the drones and missiles crossing the night sky was widely shared on social media.
President Joe Biden rushed back to the White House on Saturday evening from his weekend beach getaway in Delaware for an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the attack.
The president spoke with Netanyahu on the phone, CNN reported.

Biden again said in the face of Iran’s threats that his commitment to Israel’s security is “ironclad” — a change from the harsh criticism voiced in recent weeks over the war in Gaza.
Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said any direct hit by Iranian drones on Israeli soil “will probably” elicit a response ten-fold.

“If Israel is hit and is hit in a sensitive location, Israel will respond heavily,” he said. He said Iran launching drone strikes “is obviously a significant escalation. There’s no other way to put this.” 
Schanzer said in theory there’s “very little” difference between Iran directly attacking Israel versus directly conducting a strike on Jerusalem, but that the optics of a direct launch from Tehran “gives Israel an opportunity now to turn the tables on the regime.”

“The Iranians can no longer claim to be the aggrieved party. It’s a direct strike after having coordinated literally thousands of strikes from proxies. This is a moment that I would say has been inevitable in the region for several decades now, where the regime is finally owning its own aggression and it will give the Israelis ample opportunity to respond.”
Schanzer noted though that if Israel manages to take out “95 to 95%” of Iran’s drones in Saturday’s strike “that may be the end of it,” or may choose to retaliate at some later point.  
“They’ll have the time and space to decide to do so. so much depends on how successful these drone strikes are when anticipating a response.”

The body of a missing Israeli teen shepherd was found in the West Bank Saturday morning, and officials are treating the killing as a terror attack.
Benjamin Achimeir, 14, was last seen leaving the settlement of Malachei Shalom early Friday, Israeli media reported. The sheep he was shepherding later returned without him.
His body was spotted by a drone on Saturday. The teen is believed to have been shot, but that report has not been confirmed.

The Israeli army has classified the killing as a “terrorist attack.”

No one group immediately claimed responsibility for the murder.

“We will get to the murderers and their helpers as we do to anyone who harms the citizens of the state of Israel,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday.
He ordered the Israel Defense Forces, Shin Bet and Israel Police to conduct a wide-scale intelligence and operational probe into the Palestinian villages near where the boy was found, the Jerusalem Post reported.

Achimeir’s vanishing sparked a wave of settler violence against the Palestinian village of al-Mughayyir.
During Friday’s outcry, 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia was killed and 25 others were reportedly wounded, according to Palestinian health officials.
Dozens of settlers returned to the village following the discovery of the teen’s body Saturday and burned 12 homes and several cars, according to reports.

Three more people in the village were injured, one critically, health officials said.
In the nearby village of Douma, Israeli settlers set fire to about 15 homes and 10 farms, the head of the village council, Slieman Dawabsheh, said.
The Israeli army used tear gas and rubber bullets against the villagers, he claimed.

Tensions between settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank — which is claimed as Palestinian territory, though it has been occupied by Israel since 1967— have run particularly high since the Oct. 7 terror attack.
While the Hamas terror group fends off an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip, its allies are also reportedly trying to ignite a second front in the West Bank.

According to the Associated Press, over 460 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli gunfire over the past six months.

The fallout from Binyamin Achimeir’s death comes as Israel braces for a seemingly imminent direct attack from Iran, which has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike earlier this month that killed a Revolutionary Guards leader.
The IRGC has already commandeered a Portuguese-flagged, Israeli-linked ship near the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Israeli-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz in the latest escalation of the simmering standoff between the two countries.
An unverified video of the incident first obtained by the Associated Press showed IRGC commandos rappelling onto the MSC Aries vessel, the Times of Israel reported.
“Don’t come out,” a crew member on the ship can be heard saying in the footage, which was also posted on X by Times of Israel reporter Mannie Fabian.

The crew member can then be heard telling another to head to the ship’s bridge, as more IRGC commanders were rappelling onto the desk.

One commando is seen kneeling over the others to protect them from potential cover fire, the Times of Israel reported.

								US will not take part in any Israeli retaliatory action against Iran							










The seized ship is a Portuguese-flagged vessel affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a London-based outfit of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group, the outlet explained.
Portuguese authorities are in contact with Iran about the seizure, Portugal’s government told CNN.
None of the sailors are believed to be Portuguese, the outlet said.
There are believed to be about 25 crew on board, CNN added, citing the Mediterranean Shipping Company.
The MSC Aries was last located off Dubai and headed for the Strait of Hormuz on Friday.
The ship then turned off its tracking data, which is common practice for Israeli-affiliated vessels in the region, the Times of Israel reported.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations had earlier reported a ship seizure near the Strait of Hormuz, but could only confirm that “regional authorities” were responsible, CNN said.
Iran’s Tasnim and IRNA state news agencies both appeared to confirm that the IRGC was involved in the incident, the Times of Israel and CNN reported, respectively.

The IRGC has directed the ship “back to Iranian territorial waters,” according to IRNA.
“The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have seized a Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,” Israel’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz wrote on X Saturday.
“The Ayatollah regime of…is a criminal regime that supports Hamas’ crimes and is now conducting a pirate operation in violation of international law,” he added.
Katz demanded that the European Union and the “free world” declare the IRGC a “terrorist organization” and impose sanctions on Iran.
Israel is currently on high alert for a direct attack from Tehran, which is expected to avenge an April 1 strike that killed seven Iranian military officers “sooner than later,” according to US officials.
Any direct conflict between Israel and Iran threatens to turn Israel’s war against Tehran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip into a region-wide conflict.

The US is planning to help Israel shoot down any incoming missiles and drones from Iran and is moving two US Navy destroyers nearby, according to reports — as the Jewish state awaits retaliation for its assassination of an Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader.
The tense situation in the Middle East was compounded on Saturday after Hezbollah, an Iran proxy in Lebanon, launched 40 rockets into northern Israel.

The Israeli military responded hours later with airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces announced.
Some of Hezbollah’s rockets were intercepted, while others fell into open areas, the military explained.

Hezbollah continued to send more drones into Israel throughout Saturday, including one that exploded on a kibbutz and seriously wounded an IDF reserve soldier, the army said.
The IDF launched additional attacks on the sources of the drones in southern Lebanon, it added.

Israel is still on high alert for a direct attack from Iran, which experts said was expected imminently. However, Hezbollah’s rocket attack appeared to be just another continuation of cross-border attacks that the terrorist group has been carrying out regularly since the Israel-Gaza war began. 
By Friday, the US moved two guided-missile destroyers capable of intercepting drones and incoming missiles closer to Israel in anticipation of the attack, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The US is prepared to help Israel incept missiles from Iran, which is reportedly readying a revenge strike for the April 1 Israeli attack that killed seven Iranian military officers, CNN reported, citing sources.
One person familiar with US intelligence told the outlet that the country had readied as many as 100 cruise missiles.

Tehran’s direct attack on Israeli soil would mark a serious escalation of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which now threatens to give way to a larger regional conflict.
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, and Tehran has been accused of encouraging the former’s Oct. 7 terror attack on southern Israel.
President Biden said Friday that the revenge attack would come “sooner than later.”
“Don’t,” the president cautioned Tehran.

“We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel and help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” he added.
The US recently observed Iran moving military assets internally, CNN reported.

Even with US support, it would be difficult for Israel to defend itself from such massive bombardment, one expert told CBS News on Friday.
“Iran will bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further,” IDF Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari vowed Saturday.
Israel also coped with internal strife Saturday as settlers in the West Bank rampaged through the village of al-Mughayyir and injured six Palestinians, the Times of Israel reported.

Footage from the scene showed the illegal settlers firing in the direction of the Palestinians and throwing stones at them, the outlet said.
One person was critically wounded after being shot in the head.
The clash broke out shortly after the body of Benjamin Achimeir – a 14-year-old Israeli boy from Jerusalem – was found near al-Mughayyir, the Times of Israel explained.
Achimeir vanished early Friday when he went out shepherding. The IDF has classified his murder as a terror attack, the Times of Israel noted.
Before the teen’s body was found, Israeli settlers set fire to houses and cars in al-Mughayyir, the outlet said.
One person, 26-year-old Jehad Abu Alia, was killed in that initial conflict.
Tensions between Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank have heated up in the months since Oct. 7, sparking concerns that Hamas will take advantage of the conflict to infiltrate those communities.

					Reza Pahlavi, the Crown Prince of Iran photographed in Washington, DC. The exiled heir hopes to help his countrymen transition away from extremism and toward secular and democratic rule.						
							Samuel Corum for NY Post						




Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi – the son of the last Shah of Iran and heir to the Peacock Throne – hasn’t been home in 45 years. Neither has his wife, Yasmine.
Their three daughters, raised in the suburbs of Washington, DC, have never set foot in their ancestral homeland. 
Now 63, Pahlavi left Iran at age 17 for military school in the United States just before his cancer-stricken father, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, relinquished the throne on Jan. 16, 1979. 
The Shah’s departure left behind a leadership vacuum filled by Ruhollah Khomeini, which catalyzed Iran’s transformation into the conservative theocracy cut off from the Western world that we now know today.

Since that time, Pahlavi, who studied the nonviolent philosophies of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, has remained transfixed on one goal: igniting a revolution that replaces the brutal regime now governing Iran with a secular democracy chosen by and for the Iranian people.

“The Islamic regime is the root cause of the problems we see in the region, whether it’s terrorism, radicalism or the nuclear proliferation threat,” Pahlavi recently told The Post. “It’s in the ayatollahs’ DNA to be an enemy to modernization and progress. Look at what Dubai is today compared to 40 years ago,” he continues. “Instead of becoming the next Japan, Iran has become the next North Korea.” 
Pahlavi’s words come months into the Hamas war with Israel — a conflict with deep roots in Tehran’s commitment to exporting extremism far beyond its borders. 
The mullahs’ support of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has been extensively chronicled, and recent reporting showed that Iran has also been smuggling arms to the West Bank to foment further unrest in Israel.

Such ambitions — along with Iran’s increasing closeness with Russia and China — help explain Pahlavi’s belief that Western governments should stop engaging in futile diplomacy with the Islamic Republic and focus more on empowering Iranians directly. 
“Iranian people represent the true agents of change,” he said. “We should be investing in them, not paying the regime more money to continue . . . financing their proxies.” 





When the US is weak in its foreign policy, Tehran is emboldened to sow chaos at home and abroad, Pahlavi continues. 
Executions in Iran, the regime’s military spend and its nuclear weapons advancement have all increased significantly as administrations under Obama and Biden appeased, rather than challenged, the regime, according to the National Union for Democracy in Iran. 
“The premise of dealing with the regime in terms of negotiation and diplomacy is based on the false expectation of behavior change,” Pahlavi said, adding that the Hamas attack on Israel occurred, in part, because Tehran was emboldened by weakness out of Washington, such as Biden’s back-door deal last year to transfer $6 billion to Iran in exchange for five US prisoners.

Pahlavi’s supporters, consisting of secularists, constitutional monarchists and liberal democrats, laud him as the man who should have been Shah. 
For them, he is an assiduous statesman who last year represented the Iranian people’s democratic aspirations in official visits to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the Munich Security Conference and Israel.
Although Israel and Iran remain locked in a shadow war edging precipitously closer toward nuclear brinkmanship — particularly after an Israeli strike in Damascus in early April killed senior Iranian military commanders — Pahlavi envisages the unthinkable: a Cyrus Accords between Israel and a post-Ayatollah Iran. 
Although still a dream, it would be modeled on both the existing Abraham Accords between Israel and Gulf states, as well as the decades of close trade and military partnerships both countries enjoyed before the revolution. 
Pahlavi imagines a NATO-like intergovernmental alliance that advances peace, not war. 
“Imagine a region where Iran, Israel, Saudi and the UAE redirect money allocated to defense and security to education and healthcare,” he explains.

But regional instability has instead dominated Tehran’s foreign policy agenda. 
Hamas’ abduction of 253 mostly Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 relied on a strategy emanating from Tehran, whose leaders pioneered captive diplomacy with the 444-day US embassy hostage crisis in 1979. 
The Islamic Republic has since leveraged hostage taking as a winning strategy to coax the U.S. and allies into those prisoner swaps and financial rewards. 
“When you reward hostage taking by paying a ransom, what do you expect? More hostages,” Pahlavi says. 
The Hamas attacks in October were also timed to “sabotage” momentum toward a landmark, U.S.-brokered Israeli-Saudi peace agreement. Such a Sunni-Israeli alliance would have threatened Shia-majority Iran’s regional ambitions, as the U.S. rewarded Riyadh with advanced weapons and military technology in exchange for recognizing Jerusalem.

As Pahlavi explains, his grand plan for the downfall of the Islamic Republic is multi-fold: First apply “maximum pressure” on the regime through harsher sanctions on senior government and military officials — along with formal terrorist designations for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by the UK and EU. 
Then provide “maximum support” for the Iranian people, who have staged several unsuccessful attempts in recent years to unseat the Islamic Republic. 
In 2009, for instance, millions of Iranians disputed the presidential re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Then, from 2017-2019, desperate Iranians protested over water scarcity, economic hardship and political repression.

But no movement posed as existential a threat to the Islamic Republic as the uprising in September 2022, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini after she was arrested for failing to wear her hijab appropriately.
Although the movement gained worldwide attention, it faded out after mere months with little material impact on the regime. 
Opposition leadership in the Iranian diaspora unraveled abroad while Iran’s security forces launched a violent campaign of arrests and executions at home. 
More than 537 protesters were killed and and at least 20,000 were arrested. 
The slaughter continued into 2023, which saw 853 executions across Iran, the highest number on record since 2015.

Such numbers, while sobering, have mostly gone unreported. 
“There’s always less media attention on Iranian people’s causes than others,” Pahlavi said, referring to the Israel-Palestine conflict and Ukraine war. 
Part of the problem is the White House — where “the Biden administration [has] neglected to take concrete actions to support the Iranian people, who are in a David-versus-Goliath battle,” he says. “Goliath spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on PR while also restricting Internet access to its people to communicate among themselves and with the outside world.” 
Still, Pahlavi remains undeterred as revolutionary fervor persists within Iran. 
The parliamentary elections this past March, for instance, tested the regime’s long-term legitimacy as voter turnout sunk to historic lows. “We don’t need foreign countries to intervene to remove the regime,” he said. “Iranians demand change and are paying with their lives every day.”
As for what role he might play in Iran should the theocracy collapse, Pahlavi remains vague. “I’m not running for any office or position,” he notes. “For me, the finish line is the day people go to the polls and finally participate in a referendum to decide their fate.” 


10

In the meantime Pahlavi relies on his modest secretariat, or cabinet-in-exile, consisting of a handful of close political and media advisors that run his schedule and accompany him to speaking engagements.  
Pahlavi, of course, has his detractors. 
As the son of Iran’s last authoritarian monarch overthrown in a bloody revolution, many view him as lacking any real meaningful influence. 
As Thomas Juneau, assistant professor at the University of Ottowa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs has written on X, Pahlavi is surrounded by “close advisors [who] are toxic, far-right individuals who cause major damage to the opposition in exile (and so help the Islamic Republic).”
“A cult of personality has grown around Reza Pahlavi which portrays him as a man he is not and never can be,” added Alireza Nader, an Iran scholar and former Rand policy analyst. 
“According to this cult, Pahlavi alone can save Iran from the Islamic Republic. No other political figure matters, and if anyone challenges or criticizes Pahlavi, he or she is called a traitor.”

Still, no opposition figure comes close to Pahlavi’s support inside Iran and abroad. 
A recent survey by the Empirical Research and Forecasting Institute found that 79.9% of Iranians opted for Pahlavi as their favored leader over current rulers or alternative opposition figures. 
Iranians are also increasingly looking to secularize their country, with a government survey leaked to BBC Persian showing support for a demarcation between religion and state climbing from 31% in 2015 to 74% today.

A key factor of Pahlavi’s popularity is his consistent, decades-long vision for a secular and democratic Iran that adheres to nationalist sentiments already rising in the country, says Saeed Ghasseminejad, senior Iran advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
“The only alternative to the Islamic Republic’s radical Islamism that can mobilize the masses is nationalism,” Ghasseminejad said. “The three waves of widespread protests over the last six years all had strong nationalist tendencies. The crown prince, because of his position, name, and background, is naturally perceived as the leader of this return to Iran’s national identity.”

For Pahlavi, his “patriotic duty” and mission for the past 40 years have been to place Iran’s democratic transition directly in the hands of its people. “My role is to ensure we have an interim government that prepares the stage for the elections where these debates about Iran’s future and what ultimately people want takes place.” 
Jonathan Harounoff is the author of the forthcoming book “Unveiled: Inside Iran’s #WomenLifeFreedom Revolt.”

Gen. Omar Bradley is often credited with the saying, “Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.” The Biden administration does neither.
In September 2022, we argued that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “Arsenals of Evil” — North Korea and Iran — couldn’t help the Kremlin retrieve its faltering position in Ukraine.
We were wrong. 
We didn’t factor in Washington throwing in the towel after Putin’s “special military operation” was on the ropes.



President Biden left the US badly exposed to Russia and China, a process that began when he prematurely withdrew troops from Afghanistan, Jonathan Sweet and Mark Toth write. REUTERS

The two rogue states, each as anti-American as it gets, are providing Putin with drones, artillery and cruise missiles to defeat the United States and our NATO allies in Ukraine, all while pursuing their nuclear weapons programs unabated.
To underscore the extent to which America has fallen behind, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, head of US Central Command, testified before Congress that “the Russians are firing five times as many artillery shells as the Ukrainians.”

								The epic fail of Biden’s doctrine vs. Iran — no consequences							










Kurilla warned that Putin’s advantage in artillery shells would increase to 10 to 1 “in a matter of weeks.”
Russia is outproducing the US and NATO — churning out 250,000 artillery munitions per month, while NATO’s artillery coalition, led by France and the Czech Republic, is forced to scrounge on the open market to secure a one-time purchase of 800,000 rounds.
According to a senior European intelligence official, the US and Europe, collectively, can produce just 100,000 munitions each month. 
And they’re not even doing that.
The arsenals of democracy are failing.
Franklin Roosevelt is likely turning in his grave at Hyde Park, especially given that it’s Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, now occupying the White House.

editorial



		Biden’s vote-buying student debt ploy says ‘Screw you’ to taxpayers, Congress and SCOTUS	






We’ve long urged Biden to put the country on a war footing to defeat Putin in Ukraine, deter future Russian aggression in Europe and check Chinese President Xi Jinping’s designs on Taiwan and the greater Indo-Pacific.
Democracy is in real danger of losing to tyranny.
Ukraine has now been at war for 777 days. 
Yet here we are, without a plan to win or a sufficient level of weapons and munitions production to meet an array of cascading kinetic conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, Israel and Iranian-backed attacks on US forces and commercial shipping in Syria, Iraq, Jordan and the Red Sea.
Taiwan sits more exposed than ever. 
Beijing undoubtedly sees the opening and is poised to exploit it.
We are no longer in either/or territory.
Biden lost that opportunity when he failed to put Putin down for the count by enabling Kyiv to retake Crimea.
Just as World War II required an “all of the above” response, so too does this increasingly kinetic World War III.
Yet Biden, along with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, has been utterly derelict in their approach.
He’s left the nation badly exposed to Russia and China, a process that began when he prematurely withdrew US troops from Afghanistan.
Emerging exigencies, including Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power grid and the growing potential for an all-out war between Israel and Iran, now require a bold new commitment from Biden. 
The White House must focus on winning this global war with Moscow and Beijing and their arsenal of evil partners.
Instead of recognizing the gravity of the overall strategic situation and leveling with the American people that we are, in effect, facing a World War III, the White House is admonishing US allies to tamp back their fights against our nation’s enemies so as to not risk Biden losing in Michigan or elsewhere.

Biden & Co. have told Israel to refrain from defeating Hamas in Rafah.
Likewise, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin admonished Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to stop attacking Russian oil refineries, lest global oil prices rise — and, presumably, dim Biden’s re-election prospects come November.
Instead, Austin urged Ukraine to focus on military targets.
Sorry, but Russian oil refineries are military targets: They’re used to facilitate the transport of Russian troops and munitions to the front lines in Ukraine — and generate revenue to finance the war.
Biden, Blinken, Sullivan and Austin have lost the plot. 
They’re aware of the US’s dire armaments production situation; they’ve borrowed munitions from forward-deployed arsenals in Israel and South Korea to aid in Ukraine’s war effort.

Yet Biden’s overall national intelligence strategy fails to realize that all of the dots it maps are connected — and, allegorically speaking, clearly form the maps of Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.
Former President Barack Obama was right when he warned folks never to underestimate Biden’s ability to f–k things up.
The president is doing just that at a national security level, and at the worst possible moment.
Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Sweet served 30 years as a military intelligence officer. Mark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy.

WASHINGTON — President Biden said Friday that his message to Iran is “don’t” attack Israel — after forecasting that Tehran is likely to do so “sooner than later.”
The 81-year-old commander in chief addressed two days of fevered speculation of a looming attack on the set of the “fake” White House in an office building adjacent to the West Wing.
Asked “how imminent” an attack on Israel may be, Biden said, “my expectation is sooner than later” following his virtual address to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.

Asked for his message to Iran, Biden said a single word: “Don’t.”

“We are devoted to the defense of Israel. We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” he said in response to another question.
Hours earlier, the White House refused to say how the US would respond if Iran acts on its “very credible” threats to strike Israel — as fears grow that such an attack could trigger a wider war across the Middle East.
While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the Biden administration considers Tehran’s warnings against the Jewish state to be “viable,” he declined to detail what Washington would do should an attack occur.

“We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel,” Kirby said. 
“We are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks, but I really don’t want to get into armchair quarterbacking this thing in a public way.”

Iran says any attack would be in retaliation for Israel’s April 1 strike near the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, which killed Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who managed paramilitary operations in Syria and Lebanon, and at least six other Iranian militants, according to Iranian state media and US officials. 


4

Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder declined to say whether the US military would respond to an Iranian strike on Israel ZUMAPRESS.com
Zahedi was the highest-ranking Iranian military official to be killed since the January 2020 US assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.
On Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder also refused to answer questions on a potential US response to an attack from Iran, saying he wouldn’t “get into hypotheticals.”
“We’re certainly monitoring the situation closely,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball and I’m not going to get into specific intelligence.”
Rich Goldberg, the former official in charge of countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction in the Trump White House and a senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Post the US focus is on preventing Iranian drones or missiles from reaching Israeli territory.
“My understanding through sources in both countries is that the cooperation between US Central Command and the Israel Defense Forces right now is at a maximalist, unprecedented level, so there is a very enhanced state of cooperation right now on the threat,” Goldberg said.
While the Biden administration has refused to talk about possible responses against Iran, Goldberg saidit would be highly unusual for Israel to ask for US assistance should it need to retaliate.
“Israel has never asked the United States to fight on its behalf or to intervene on its behalf and I would be shocked to learn that it has done so,” he said.
Still, Goldberg noted that the Pentagon has assets in the Middle East that could help shoot down an incoming missile from Iran, should it be necessary.

“To the extent that the US is providing missile defense support, that would be in accordance with US policy doctrine and 20 years of military exercises between the United States military and Israeli military, so that, to me, is appropriate,” he said.
The calculus would likely change if Iran moves against US forces in the region.
“It would be imprudent if we didn’t take a look at our own posture in the region to make sure that we’re properly prepared as well,” Kirby said Friday.
Tehran reportedly told its allies last week that it would attack American military bases if Washington should get involved in the fighting between Iran and Israel, Axios reported Friday, citing unnamed US officials.
“The Iranian message was we will attack the forces that attack us, so don’t f–k with us and we won’t f–k with you,” one official told Axios.

Goldberg further noted that there appears to be some “signaling of major escalation prepared by the Israelis … if there is a direct missile attack from Iran.”
“That would be in the form of one of their intermediate-range or medium-range ballistic missiles, a cruise missile” that could “cause a large amount of destruction.”
The Iranian regime has not made a final decision regarding how and when to launch the attack, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
“The strike plans are in front of the Supreme Leader and he is still weighing the political risk,” an adviser to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told the outlet.

Many unknowns remain around Iran’s promised retaliation against Israel for its killing of a cluster of Quds Force fighters (including top brass) in Syria.
One thing is certain, however: This is President Biden’s foreign policy working by design. 
That’s why America’s most committed regional enemy is menacing our most important regional ally, as US analysts sit and mull over the size and scope of the strike — and the White House basically wrings its hands. 
Not that Iran needs to do anything big.

Thanks to Biden, Iran already is winning the battle for regional supremacy with proxy actions.
Israel’s already fighting an Iranian proxy on one front in Gaza as another, Hezbollah, has been launching rockets across the border with Lebanon and exchanging fire with Israeli forces in what may well be a prelude to open war.  
Meanwhile, the president, guided both by short-term hopes of winning back lefty voters and by a cadre of demented lefties on his staff, has abandoned Israel. 
But from the day he took office, long before Iran struck Israel via its cat’s-paw Hamas, Biden has empowered and emboldened Tehran.

He handed it billions in ransom and sanctions relief, broke off relations with the Saudis and did all he could to resuscitate President Barack Obama’s disastrous 2015 nuclear deal. 
And now we face the possibility of hot hostilities between Israel and Iran. 
Perhaps Biden’s calculation is that Iran will make a conservative play here.

But if Tehran, say, dares a major strike against a soft target: What then?
The US must respond. 
Biden cannot continue to base his Mideast strategy on hopes and fairy tales about Iran. 

An attack by the ayatollahs cannot be shrugged off.
Whatever happens, know that Biden owns this disaster, and that absent political change in November, the policy fundamentals that produced it will go on making the world less safe.

The threat of a widening war in the Middle East coupled with disappointing earnings reports from US banks prompted a selloff on Wall Street on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 475 points, finishing at 37,983, and has now lost roughly 5% off its record high after flirting with the 40,000 barrier to close out March.
The S&P 500 sank 1.5% – dropping more than 75 points, while the Nasdaq was down 267 points, or 1.6%.

Oil prices soared above $90 a barrel, on threats by Iran that it will launch an attack against Israel as early as this weekend.

Back home, JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s biggest bank by assets, reported quarterly profits of 6%, but shares dropped after its forecast for income from interest payments fell short of analysts’ expectations.
Citigroup, meanwhile, saw first-quarter profit drop 27% as the bank continues to restructure itself and slim down after selling off much of its international franchises post pandemic.

Wells Fargo’s profit fell 7% in the first quarter as it paid more to hold customer deposits while demand from borrowers declined.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, in a call with analysts after the mixed earnings report, reiterated his concerns that inflation would continue to weigh on the US economy.

“Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces,” Dimon said, citing the wars in Gaza and Ukraine as well as other geopolitical pressures, high amounts of government spending and “persistent inflationary pressures” as part of an “unsettling” global landscape.
The market selloff is a result of a transition from “overoptimism” on the part of investors who expected interest rate cuts to “over pessimism” that the Fed will keep interest rates where they are, according to Dr. Sung Won Sohn, a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

According to Sohn, the market rally since October – which has seen the Dow climb by more than 12% – were based on expectations of interest rate cuts.
“The tailwind has disappeared and it’s become somewhat of a headwind,” Sohn told The Post.
He also cited the price of oil, which could soar to between $100 and $150 a barrel if Iran attacks Israel and triggers a regional conflict.
“The stock market was overvalued to begin with,” he said. “Now they are reversing and becoming concerned about the future.”

Shares of JPMorgan and other big banks fell as they reported earnings. REUTERS
Earlier this week, the federal government released data showing that inflation in March rose 3.5% year-over-year – a reading that came in a higher than the 3.4% that economists anticipated.
Sticky inflation has tamped down expectations on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates at least three times this year.

A new consensus is emerging among investors who now say that any rate cut would be implemented in September at the earliest.
Initial projections had the Fed cutting rates beginning in June.

        Iran launches swarm of kamikaze drones at Israel

    
                    Tehran has fired dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles in apparent retaliation for an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus
            An Iranian Shahed drone is shown at a weapons exhibition. Iran launched an attack against Israel on Saturday night using dozens of drones and missiles, in apparent retaliation for a recent strike by the Jewish state that killed seven military officers at its consulate in Damascus.Axios reported the drone swarm on Saturday, citing four unidentified US and Israeli officials. Videos posted on social media purported to show Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being fired toward Israel from Iran.Earlier on Saturday, US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his national security advisers due to fears of an “imminent” Iranian attack against Israel. Tehran, which had vowed to take revenge for the April 1 killing of its officers, seized an Israeli-operated container ship in the Persian Gulf around noon on Saturday.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari warned in a video statement that Iran would “bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further. Israel is on high alert.” Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US assets in the region amid West Jerusalem’s war with Hamas.

                    Tehran has launched retaliatory strikes following a deadly airstrike that killed two Iranian generals earlier this month
            An Israeli soldier stands atop a tank in a army camp near Israel's border with Gaza, April 8, 2024 ©                 AFP / Menahem KahanaIran has launched a wave of drones toward Israel, after American officials warned that hundreds of drones and missiles could rain down on the Jewish state over the weekend.Iran accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike on its consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus earlier this month. The strike killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Israel stuck to its usual policy of silence on extraterritorial assassinations, but is widely believed to have been behind the attack.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to deal Israel a “slap in the face” in response, and American officials warned on Friday that Tehran could be gearing up for a massive drone and missile strike on Israeli soil in the following 24 to 48 hours. The Iranian response appeared to begin at midday on Saturday when IRGC commandos seized an Israeli-linked container ship in the Strait of Hormuz. This live stream has ended.14 April 202407:48 GMTIran has no plans to continue its military operation against Israel, the chief of staff of the Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, says. However, he warned West Jerusalem that if it takes any further offensive actions against Tehran, they would be met with a “much more extensive” response.07:17 GMTThe head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Major General Hossein Salami, claimed that Tehran’s attack on Israel was even more successful than previously believed.“Up to this moment, our information on all the hits is not complete, but the part of the hits that we have accurate… reports about shows… that this operation happened with more success than expected,” he said, as quoted by the IRNA news agency.He added that the “Zionist authorities and the terrorist army” as well as the US, Israel’s ally, “have recognized the devastating effects of these strikes better than we did.”06:47 GMTPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that Israel has successfully repelled the Iranian drone and missile strikes. “We have stopped them… Together we will win,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).06:23 GMTUS President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington would not support an Israeli counterattack against Iran in retaliation for the massive missile and drone strikes, Axis reported, citing unnamed US officials.The US is said to be extremely concerned that an Israeli response could trigger a major war with “catastrophic consequences.” In light of this, Biden advised Netanyahu to “take the win,” according to an Axios source.The Israeli prime minister reportedly told Biden that he understands the US stance on retaliatory strikes.05:57 GMTThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it has conducted airstrikes on military sites belonging to Iranian-linked Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces, a special unit whose primary mission is to infiltrate Israeli territory, in the Jbaa area of southern Lebanon.Israeli fighter jets also struck Hezbollah military sites in the Khiam and Kfarkela areas in the same region, the IDF added, sharing a video of the raids.מטוסי קרב תקפו לפני זמן קצר במחנה השייך לכוח רדואן, מספר מבנים במרחב הכפר ג׳בע שבדרום לבנון.מוקדם יותר הלילה מטוסי קרב תקפו מבנים צבאיים של ארגון הטרור חיזבאללה במרחבים אל-חיאם וכפר כילא pic.twitter.com/dlMSOrqR38— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) April 14, 202405:35 GMTIsrael has reopened its airspace after being closed for seven hours due to the Iranian attack, according to the country’s Airports Authority. It added, however, that some flight schedules are subject to change.05:00 GMTThe Pentagon has confirmed that US military forces in the Middle East intercepted “dozens” of drones and missiles “en route to Israel” launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen on Saturday.“Our forces remain postured to protect US troops and partners in the region, provide further support for Israel’s defense, and enhance regional stability,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.He urged Iran to “immediately halt any further attacks,” adding that while the US is not seeking a direct confrontation with Iran, it will not “hesitate to act” in the event of a potential threat to US military forces or in support for Israeli defense.03:17 GMT

President Joe Biden has praised the US military and American servicemembers for helping the IDF to deflect what he called an “unprecedented air attack against military facilities in Israel.""”At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said in a statement published by the White House.03:16 GMTIran’s Foreign Ministry said that the Islamic Republic “will not hesitate to take more defensive measures to protect its legitimate interests against any aggressive military actions and illegal use of force,” referring to the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria.Citing the goals and principles of the UN charter, Tehran reaffirmed “its determination to forcefully defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any unlawful use of force and aggressions,” the ministry added as cited by semi-government IRNA news agency.02:47 GMTUS President Joe Biden held a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following a meeting with his national security team, but the details of the discussions have not been disclosed.More

        Iran confirms ‘extensive’ strike against Israel

    
                    The Islamic Republic has launched multiple drones on the Jewish state, according to media reports
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 Global Look Press / Iranian Army OfficeA military operation has been carried out against Israeli targets in the Occupied Palestinian territories, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement on Saturday night. The drone and missile strike was a response to “numerous crimes” committed by West Jerusalem, it claimed, including an attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, it added.“In response to the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes... and the martyrdom of a number of our country’s commanders and military advisors in Syria, the IRGC’s Aerospace Division launched tens of missiles and drones against certain targets inside the occupied territories,” the statement said.The exact targets of the strike remain unknown. It is also unclear if the IRGC was referring to the Occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank or Israeli territory when announcing the strike. Several media outlets earlier reported that multiple drones were targeting Israeli territory. Tehran said it would provide further details about the operation soon.The development came two weeks after an alleged Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The attack, which took place on April 1, killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals.

        Biden convenes security meeting over Iranian attack

    
                    Washington has responded to the latest salvo in the Middle East by reiterating its “ironclad” support for Israel’s security
            ©                 AP / Pablo Martinez MonsivaisThe administration of US President Joe Biden has reacted to an Iranian drone attack against Israel by vowing steadfast support for West Jerusalem. The president cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his national security advisers.“President Biden has been clear: Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad,” US National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said on Saturday in a White House statement. “The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran.”The statement was issued shortly after Iran launched a swarm of suicide drones against Israel on Saturday night, in apparent retaliation for a missile strike that killed seven military officers at its consulate in Damascus earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the drone raid, saying it was launched from within Iranian territory.

Watson said the attack is “likely to unfold over a number of hours.” Biden is receiving regular updates on the situation from his national security advisers. “His team is in constant communication with Israeli officials, as well as other partners and allies,” the spokeswoman added.”Hours before the drones were launched, Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach home, returning to the White House for consultations with his advisers on fears of an “imminent” Iranian strike against Israel.US defense chief Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, in a telephone call earlier on Saturday. Their conversation concerned “urgent regional threats” and “unwavering US support for Israel’s defense,” Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said. “Secretary Austin made clear that Israel could count on full US support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies.”

Iranian-backed militias have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US assets across the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began last October. Iranian forces seized an Israeli-operated container ship in the Persian Gulf around midday on Saturday.Tehran has vowed to take revenge against Israel for the April 1 airstrike on its Syria consulate. Shortly after Saturday’s drone attack began, the X (formerly Twitter) account of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reposted a clip from the Iranian supreme leader’s speech on Wednesday denouncing the missile strike.“When they attack our consulate, it is as if they have attacked our soil,” Khamenei said in the speech. “The malicious regime made a mistake on this matter, and it must be punished and will be punished.”

        Iran warns foreign nations against helping Israel

    
                    Any country that provides air or land passage for West Jerusalem’s troops will face Tehran’s wrath, the Islamic Republic has said
            FILE PHOTO: Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani ©                 Global Look Press / DefanewsAny nation that helps Israel attack Iran will face serious consequences, the Islamic Republic’s defense minister, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, warned early Sunday. His statement came as Tehran launched a massive airstrike against the Jewish state, in what it called retaliation for an Israeli attack on an Iranian consulate in Syria.“Any country that opens its airspace or soil to Israel to attack Iran will receive our decisive response,” Ashtiani said.Iran’s mission to the UN also demanded that the US “stay away” from the conflict between Tehran and West Jerusalem. This is a bilateral issue, the mission said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday night. The Islamic Republic has the right to respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which grants every nation the right to self-defense, the statement said, pointing to Israeli “aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus.”

Earlier, Tehran confirmed that it had launched multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Israel and announced an imminent missile strike. The Israeli military tracked more than 100 drones heading towards the country, local media reported, adding that the UAVs are expected to reach Israel “within hours” and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will work to intercept them mid-air.The development prompted several Middle Eastern nations, including Jordan and Lebanon, to close their airspace. Amman also declared a state of emergency.The targets of the attack remain unclear. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) called the attack retaliation against Israel’s “numerous crimes,” including an early April strike targeting an Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus.The attack killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals, and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there would be a response. The US warned Israel on Friday that Tehran could launch a massive strike against it over the weekend.

        Israel & allies intercept incoming Iranian drones – media

    
                    West Jerusalem and its allies have reportedly shot down more than 100 UAVs
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 Global Look Press / JINI / Ayal MargolinThe US and other Western allies are reportedly helping Israel to defend against retaliatory Iranian airstrikes, deploying fighter jets and other defenses to intercept incoming drones and cruise missiles before they reach Israeli territory.American forces began shooting down unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the skies over Iraq and Syria on Saturday night, according to unconfirmed Israeli reports. More than 100 Iranian kamikaze drones were taken out by US and UK forces before they reached West Jerusalem’s airspace, the Israeli military’s Army Radio outlet reported.Israeli and British fighter jets were reportedly launched to intercept Iranian drones over Jordan. UK pilots allegedly took off from Cyprus after Iran began launching suicide drones against Israel on Saturday night, in apparent retaliation for a missile strike earlier this month that killed seven military officers at the Iranian consulate in Damascus.With Tehran vowing revenge, US and Israeli leaders have been bracing for attacks in recent days. US President Joe Biden cut short a weekend visit to his Delaware beach house earlier on Saturday, returning to the White House to meet with his national security advisers. “We are devoted to the defense of Israel,” Biden said before the drone raids began. “We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel, and Iran will not succeed.”

Local broadcaster Channel 12 reported that in addition to the drone swarms, cruise missiles were launched into Israel. The Houthi rebels in Yemen launched drones toward Eilat, the outlet said. The Houthis and other Iranian-backed militias have ramped up attacks against Israeli and US targets across the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began last October.

The Iranian Defense Ministry warned its neighbors against allowing Israel to use their airspace for strikes against Tehran. Iran launched Shahed UAVs from within its own territory, and the drones apparently passed through Iraqi and Syrian airspace on their way to Israel.Israel is preparing for several days of clashes with Iran, and an Israeli response to Saturday’s airstrikes is expected, broadcaster KAN reported. Earlier on Saturday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari warned that Iran would “bear the consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further.”

Israel is preparing for several days of clashes with Iran, and an Israeli response to Saturday’s airstrikes is expected, local broadcaster KAN reported. Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN suggested that Tehran may be satisfied with its retaliation for the attack on its Syrian consulate.“The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said in a statement. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the US must stay away.”The statement also noted that Saturday’s military action was carried out under Article 51 off the UN Charter, concerning the rights of nations to “legitimate defense.”

        Iran vows to punish ‘evil Zionist regime’

    
                    Tehran has reiterated Ayatollah Khamenei’s pledge to avenge the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria
            Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, April 10, 2024. ©                 Khamenei Media on XThe Iranian authorities have reposted an address by the Islamic Republic’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, in which he vowed to punish Israel for the attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which occurred earlier this month.A video of the April 10 speech was widely shared across Iranian government accounts on X (formerly Twitter) early Sunday, following the launch of Iranian drones against Israel. In the address, the supreme leader condemned the Israeli airstrike on the compound that killed seven Iranian officers, including two high-ranking generals, and compared the strike to an attack on Iran itself.“The malicious regime itself, which is all malice, evil, and error, added another mistake to its own errors by launching an attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria,” Khamenei said, noting that “the consulate and embassy offices in any country where they exist are regarded as the soil of the country to which the embassy belongs.”He added that Israel’s actions “should be punished and will be punished.”

Tehran launched a barrage of drones towards Israel late Saturday. According to media reports, US officials estimate that up to 500 drones and missiles launched from various locations, including Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, will rain down on Israel over the weekend.The permanent mission of Iran to the UN issued a statement overnight, saying “Iran’s military action” constitutes “a legitimate defense” based on the UN charter. “The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission added, warning of “considerably more severe” consequences if Israel continues on its current course. The agency said the conflict is exclusively between Tehran and West Jerusalem, stressing that “the US must stay away.”

        Netanyahu convenes war cabinet

    
                    Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his nation after Iran launched waves of drones towards Israel
            The Israeli war cabinet, chaired by PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Tel Aviv, Israel, April 14, 2024.  © Getty Images /                 Israeli Government Press Office / Handout/AnadoluIsrael is ready to harm whoever harms it, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement early Sunday after Iran launched several waves of drones at Israel in response to the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.Tehran accused West Jerusalem of the April 1 airstrike, which killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. While Israel has kept silent on the matter – its usual policy on extraterritorial assassinations – it is widely believed to have carried out the attack. Iran has vowed to deal Israel a “slap in the face,” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying West Jerusalem “should be punished” and “will be punished.”Following the launch of Iranian drones and missiles towards Israel on Saturday night, Netanyahu released a video statement in which he announced that West Jerusalem has been preparing for a direct attack by Tehran for years and especially in recent weeks.

The team of US President Joe Biden is in constant communication with Israeli officials as the situation unfolds, the White House stated in a press release, reiterating their support for Israel.

                    Multiple IDF sites have been hit and destroyed, the Revolutionary Guard Corps claims
            ©                 X / Tasnimnews_ENIran has conducted a successful large-scale missile and drone attack against Israel, the Revolutionary Guard Corps has said in a statement published by IRNA news agency. The Islamic Republic’s military managed to hit and destroy “important military targets,” it added without providing further details.The strikes were a response to what Tehran called “numerous crimes” committed by West Jerusalem, including an alleged Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The attack, which took place on April 1, killed seven officers of the IRGC’s Quds Force, including two generals.The Islamic Republic’s attack involved more than 100 drones, Israeli and Western media reported. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it tracked incoming unmanned aerial vehicles and intercepted them mid-air, with help from allied forces.

In a statement, the IRGC warned the US that any support it provides to Israel that harms Iran’s interests would be met with a “decisive response.” Tehran considers Washington “responsible for the evil actions” of West Jerusalem, the statement added. Iran also warned its neighbors against assisting the US or Israel in potentially attacking the Islamic Republic.In the wake of the Iranian strikes, Israeli media reported that the government is planning a massive retaliation. TV Channel 12 cited a senior Israeli official as saying that an “unprecedented response” to the attack is in the works. Israel’s culture and sports minister, Miki Zohar, also stated that West Jerusalem “received broad international legitimacy tonight to strike Iran with unprecedented force.”

        IDF confirms ‘minor damage’ to military base

    
                    Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, the military has said
            Explosion in the skies above Ramallah, West Bank during Iran's attack on Israel, April 14, 2024  © Getty Images /                 Issam Rimawi/Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael and its allies shot down the vast majority of drones and missiles fired by Iran overnight, with just a single military base sustaining minor damage to its infrastructure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported on Sunday.Tehran launched a multi-wave air raid against Israel on Saturday evening in response to an airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria, which killed seven members of Tehran’s military, including two generals. While Israel has remained silent on the airstrike – its usual habit after extraterritorial assassinations – Tehran has accused the IDF of attacking its embassy.More than 300 drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles were fired from Iran overnight, the IDF said in a press release on Sunday morning.

Around 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles were intercepted by air defenses, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Hagari said. He added that of the 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles fired at Israel overnight, only a few of the ballistic missiles made it past the IDF’s air defenses, hitting Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel and inflicting “minor damage.”

        US helped Israel take down ‘nearly all’ Iranian drones and missiles – Biden

    
                    The president has condemned Tehran’s “unprecedented air attack”
            US President Joe Biden, along with members of his national security team, receives updates on an ongoing attack on Israel from Iran, April 13, 2024. ©                 Adam Schultz / The White House via APPresident Joe Biden has praised the US military for helping the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repel a large-scale Iranian attack against Israeli military facilities.“At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said in a statement published by the White House following a late night phone conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.The president also reaffirmed America’s “ironclad” commitment to protect Israel, while commending Israel’s “remarkable capacity” to defend against and defeat its adversaries.

Biden said he would summon G7 leaders to discuss a joint response to Iran’s military action against Israel – indicating that the reaction would be diplomatic. “We will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people,” Biden stressed, while acknowledging that US forces and facilities were not affected by Tehran’s strikes.On Saturday evening, Iran launched a coordinated multi-wave drone and missile attack on Israeli military facilities. Tehran said it was in retaliation for an airstrike allegedly conducted by the IDF on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.The IRGC claimed the operation – True Promise – was a success, with multiple “important” Israeli facilities destroyed. The IDF, however, insists that most of the UAVs were destroyed mid-air, with only minor damage resulting from the attack.

Iranian attack on Israel

        Iranian strikes on Israel: What’s known so far

    
                    Tehran has launched a massive barrage of missiles and drones in retaliation to a recent Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria
            A new wall mural is displayed at Palestine Square picturing Iran's attack on Israel in Tehran, Iran on April 14, 2024. ©                 Getty Images / Anadolu / Haydar SahinIran launched several waves of attacks against Israel overnight, apparently targeting military locations across the country. The attack triggered anti-aircraft defenses in Israel, as well as prompting Western allies, including the US and UK, to scramble jets from their bases in the Middle East in an effort to shoot down the missiles before they reach their targets.What prompted the attackThe strikes are in retaliation to an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, which occurred early this month and was attributed by Tehran to Israel. The attack left the diplomatic facility completely destroyed and killed seven officers of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.The consulate strike, which Israel has kept silent about as it usually does with regard to extraterritorial attacks, has been explicitly named as the pretext for the strikes by the IRGC. The strikes come in retaliation to “the Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus,” the Quds Force stated. Scale of the attackIran has been ambiguous on the scale of the attack, with the IRGC stating that it launched “tens of missiles and drones against certain targets inside the occupied territories,” describing the strikes as “extensive.”

A majority of the incoming missiles were shot down before even reaching Israeli airspace, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari has claimed. Only a fraction made it through, inflicting minor damage in Israel, he said.Washington has provided a similar assessment of the damage, with President Joe Biden stating that the US has “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.Numerous unverified videos circulating online, however, purport to show several projectiles making it through Israeli anti-aircraft defenses, hitting targets on the ground.International reactionThe closest allies of Israel, including the US, UK, Germany, and other Western nations, were quick to condemn the strikes. Biden has convened an emergency G7 meeting to assess the situation and “coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack.”

Israel and Iran have also traded accusations at the UN, with the latter insisting that it is exercising its right to self-defense in the wake of the consulate attack, while the former accused Tehran of breaching the UN Charter. Israel has requested an extraordinary UN Security Council meeting, urging the body to designate the IRGC as a terrorist group.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the Iranian attack as a “serious escalation” and urged an end to the hostilities immediately. “Neither the region nor the world can afford another war,” he stated.Prospects for further escalationIran has signaled that the massive strike was a one-time retaliatory action for the Israeli actions, rather than the beginning of a broader military campaign. Any attempts to retaliate for it, however, will be met with a greater response, the Iranian mission to the UN has said, explicitly warning the US against intervening.

“Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission stated, adding that “should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe.”A similar warning was issued by Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, who said any country “that could open its soil or airspace to Israel for a [potential] attack on Iran, will receive our decisive response.”PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is “prepared for any scenario, both in defense and offense,” without, however, explicitly promising to take direct military action against Iran. Since the beginning of the escalation, the IDF has only attacked several locations in southern Lebanon said to have been used by the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah.Recap

        US worried about possible Israeli counterattack on Iran – NBC

    
                    Privately, President Joe Biden is concerned West Jerusalem is attempting to pull his country into a wider conflict
            US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Washington DC, April11, 2024  © Getty Images /                 Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesIsrael's response to Iran’s recent drone strikes could prove reckless and escalatory, officials in Washington have told NBC news on condition of anonymity, the outlet reported on Sunday.Iran launched several waves of drone and missile attacks against Israel on Saturday and Sunday, in response to an airstrike that damaged Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria and killed seven military personnel – including two generals – earlier this month. While Israel has refrained from commenting on the bombing, Tehran has accused West Jerusalem of conducting an extraterritorial assassination and attacking their embassy.Some US officials privately indicated exasperation with Israel’s decision to strike the Iranian consular building in Syria, NBC claimed, citing senior Pentagon officials as calling the strike potentially “catastrophically escalatory.”Others in the White House have expressed concerns about Israel’s future response to the Iranian attack, given both West Jerusalem’s hardline approach in its conflict with Hamas and the airstrike on the embassy in Damascus, NBC News reports. President Joe Biden has privately expressed concern that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to pull the US into a broader conflict in the Middle East, three people familiar with the comments told the news channel.

Another senior administration official said that while the White House does not believe Israel is looking for a direct war with Iran, they cannot be certain of West Jerusalem’s motives. “I don’t think they had a strategy... the Israelis don’t always make the best strategic decisions,” an anonymous senior official told NBC.Some media reports that followed the bombing of Tehran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus claimed that West Jerusalem was preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities in the event of a direct Iranian attack on Israel. According to a Western security official, the Israeli Air Force has been training for long range strikes into sensitive areas of Iran which may be linked to the country’s nuclear program, London-based Arabic outlet Elaph wrote on Tuesday.

        India calls for ‘immediate de-escalation’ amid Israel-Iran tensions 

    
                    New Delhi says it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in the Middle East, which “threatens peace and security”
            Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar at a press conference with his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, Tehran, January 15, 2024. ©                 Haydar Sahin/Anadolu via Getty ImagesNew Delhi has expressed concern over the escalating hostilities between Iran and Israel, which “threatens peace and security in the region,” the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, hours after Iran conducted a retaliatory attack on Israel.Iran has launched a massive drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month. The attack killed seven officers from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two generals.“We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence, and return to the path of diplomacy,” New Delhi said in a statement. It added that it is closely monitoring the situation and its diplomatic missions are in touch with the Indian diaspora in the region.

On Saturday, the IRGC stormed an Israeli-operated container ship – MSC Aries – in the Persian Gulf and took control of the vessel. According to Indian media, of the 25 crew members aboard the ship, 17 are Indian. “We are in touch with the Iranian authorities through diplomatic channels, both in Tehran and in Delhi, to ensure security, welfare, and early release of Indian nationals,” a government source told PTI.India issued an advisory on Friday urging citizens to avoid traveling to Iran or Israel. It asked Indians residing in the two countries to observe “utmost precautions” and “restrict movements.”Tehran launched over 200 kamikaze drones, and ballistic and cruise missiles toward Israel on Friday, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson. Most of them were intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, the official claimed, adding that some reached their targets, inflicting “minor damage.” Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was quoted by IRNA news agency as saying it launched “tens of missile and drones” and “successfully hit and destroyed” key military targets belonging to the Israeli army in the occupied Palestinian territories, in response to “numerous Israeli crimes.”

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar traveled to Tehran earlier this year amid increasing attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden by Houthi rebels allegedly backed by Iran. Speaking to the media after talks with his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Jaishankar stated that the attacks on ships “in the vicinity of India” impact the nation’s energy and economic interests. Around 80% of India’s trade in goods with Europe passes through the Red Sea. The Indian Navy has significantly stepped up its presence in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, attacks by Houthi rebels, and increasing piracy activities, deploying dozens of warships that have responded to more than 18 incidents in the past three months.Where India Meets Russia – We are now on WhatsApp! ‎Follow and share RT India in English and in Hindi

Iranian attack on Israel

        ‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran

    
                    Iran’s top military commander has promised a “more extensive” response in case of future attacks by West Jerusalem
            FILE PHOTO: The Chief of Staff of Tehran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri  © Global Look Press /                 Iranian Army OfficeIran has no intention of continuing its military operation against Israel, which included massive drone and missile strikes over the weekend, the chief of staff of the Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, has said.On Saturday night, Tehran launched an “extensive” barrage on the Jewish state, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated to have included more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones. The attack came in retaliation for what Iran claims to be an Israeli airstrike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month, which killed several senior Iranian military officers.Speaking in the wake of the attack on Sunday, Bagheri explained that the reason for the attack was the “Zionist regime crossed the red line” in a way which cannot be tolerated.

Israel’s actions, the general continued, could not have gone unanswered. “The Supreme Leader also said that this punishment should be carried out and, thank God, this operation was carried out with the efforts of the [Islamic] Revolutionary Guards [Corps] and the help of other armed forces.”“We see this operation as a complete result, and this operation has ended in our opinion, and we have no intention of continuing the operation,” Bagheri said, warning Israel that if it takes any further action against Iran, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”The chief of the General Staff added that Iran’s military targeted a “large information center” that provided intel to Israel and Nevatim Airbase, which it said hosted US-designed F-35 fighters involved in the raid on the consulate in Damascus.While both of these bases were destroyed, Tehran did not attack population centers, the general claimed. Israel, however, previously said that 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles had been shot down, acknowledging only minor damage to one base.

        Netanyahu claims success in defeating Iranian attack

    
                    The Israeli military says it shot down 99% of more than 300 drones and missiles launched by Tehran
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads the weekly cabinet meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv on January 7, 2024. ©                 RONEN ZVULUN / POOL / AFPIsrael has successfully repelled a huge Iranian drone and missile attack launched overnight, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. His comments come after the Israeli military claimed to have intercepted 99% of the incoming aerial objects.Tehran launched an “extensive” barrage on the Jewish state over the weekend, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said included more than 300 missiles of various types and kamikaze drones. The attack came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli airstrike on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month that killed several senior Iranian military officers.On Sunday, in his first public comments since the attack, Netanyahu issued a brief message claiming success in repelling the onslaught. “We intercepted. We blocked. Together we will win,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Those remarks were echoed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant who insisted that Israel, the US and its partners “thwarted this attack in a way that is unparalleled.” He also said that the attack helped the world see “the true face of Iran,” which he described as a “terrorist state.”IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari assessed that “99% of the threats launched towards Israeli territory were intercepted,” hailing the development as “a very significant strategic achievement.” He said that it was based on the technological superiority of the IDF and the support of a strong coalition.At the same time, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that Tehran had managed to hit and destroy “important military targets,” without providing further details. The IDF earlier acknowledged that one of its military bases sustained minor damage.

 Iranian attack on Israel

Iran launched a wave of drone and missile attacks toward Israel on April 13. Tehran has accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike on its consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus earlier this month that killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Israel stuck to its usual policy of silence on extraterritorial assassinations but is widely believed to have been behind the attack.
The Israeli military claimed to have intercepted 99% of the incoming projectiles.

        Ukrainian ministry reveals illegal weapon risk

    
                    The government has lost track of to whom massive amounts of weapons were distributed, Igor Klimenko has said
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 AFP / Philippe DesmazesUkrainians currently possess up to 5 million weapons that have been passed out to the population by the government, Interior Minister Igor Klimenko warned on Friday. The authorities have not been able to keep track of all the arms, the minister explained, adding that a significant number of firearms are held illegally.The list of weapons is not limited to firearms, but also includes grenades, the official told a congress of local and regional authorities, according to the Ukrinform news agency. Klimenko admitted that Kiev would tolerate the illegal possession of weapons as long as the conflict with Moscow continues.“How many weapons do our citizens have in their hands? Between 1 and 5 million… How many grenades? Quite enough as well,” the minister said at the meeting. “We… understand that they should have it because there is a war going on.”

According to Klimenko, “almost all” weapons handed out by the authorities are “accounted for,” but there is also a “a certain number” of “trophy” weapons obtained by Ukrainians outside of state control.Lawmakers are currently working on a bill that would establish a procedure for citizens to either register or surrender their arms, Klimenko said. Under the proposed rules, those in possession of weapons would have to turn them over to the police 90 days after the end of martial law, according to the minister. Alternatively, people could modify their weapons to make them comply with government regulations, he added.Ukraine is yet to develop a civilian arms possession culture, the minister said, adding that many who return from the battlefield might have mental issues.

Israel warns of Ukraine weapons spillover



Russian officials previously warned that arms sent to Kiev could find their way onto the black market and into the hands of terrorists or organized crime groups. In October 2022, the Finnish authorities reported that weapons sent to Ukraine by its Western backers found their way into the Nordic nation and ended up in the hands of local criminal groups. Arms supplied to Kiev were also reportedly found in Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands at the time.In summer 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “Western anti-tank weapons” sent to Ukraine were found around Israel’s borders. A Newsweek report published around the same time suggested that not all of the Western arms intended for Ukraine had arrived at their destination. Citing an Israeli defense official, the magazine claimed that West Jerusalem had seen signs of these weapons being smuggled from Ukraine to Iran.

        Biden told Netanyahu he won’t support retaliation against Iran – Axios

    
                    Washington is reportedly worried about a major escalation fraught with “catastrophic consequences”
            US President Joe Biden (L) and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R). ©                 GPO/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Washington would not support retaliatory strikes against Iran after the latter launched a barrage of missiles and drones against the Jewish state over the weekend, Axios reported on Sunday. According to an unnamed senior White House official cited by the outlet, Biden delivered the warning during a phone call on Saturday between the two leaders. Other US officials also noted that Biden and his administration are “highly concerned” that any tit-for-tat action could trigger a regional war with “catastrophic consequences.”Given those apprehensions, Biden reportedly told Netanyahu that Israel had essentially prevailed in this clash with Iran and advised him to “take the win.” The Israeli prime minister, meanwhile, said that he understood that any retaliatory action would not be supported by the US, Axios said.

‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran



Meanwhile, an unnamed Israeli official told the Times of Israel that the country’s leadership had not yet made a decision about a potential response and that the issue would be discussed at a war cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon.Iran launched a powerful attack on Israel over the weekend that involved more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The strikes came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, early this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead.The IDF claimed to have shot down 99% of the Iranian drones and missiles, a defensive operation that Israeli officials hailed as a major success.Tehran, however, struck a different tone, with its officials insisting that the barrage had “more success than expected” and claiming that two Israeli bases had been destroyed. Israel has acknowledged only minor damage to one military facility.The chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, has signaled that his country had no intention of continuing the operation, and that it was intended as a “punishment” for Israel. He warned West Jerusalem of a “much more extensive” response if it decided to launch a counterattack.

        Russia responds to Iran’s attack on Israel

    
                    Tehran launched a wave of drone and missile strikes at the Jewish state over the weekend
            Israeli Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired from Iran, in central Israel, Sunday, April 14, 2024. ©                 AP Photo/Tomer NeubergRussia’s Foreign Ministry has called on Iran and Israel to exercise restraint and avoid a further escalation of hostilities in the region. The appeal was made in a statement on Sunday, following Tehran’s drone and missile strikes on Israel over the weekend.The attacks came in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian officers, including two generals. Tehran blamed Israel for the attack. Israel has not openly acknowledged its role, but Defense Minister Yoav Gallant implied responsibility in a later statement that Israel “strikes our enemies all over the Middle East.”“We are deeply concerned with another dangerous escalation in the region,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said, noting that crises in the Middle East, particularly the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, are “often fueled by irresponsible provocative actions” that only lead to further tensions.“We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint. We hope that regional states will solve existing problems through political and diplomatic means,” the ministry added.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran launched more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones on the Jewish state, but the IDF said that most of the incoming projectiles were shot down before reaching Israeli airspace.

Iranian officials, however, claimed that the barrage had “more success than expected.” The chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, said on Sunday that Tehran considers the weekend strikes a sufficient “punishment” of Israel for the attack on its consulate and has no intention of continuing the operation. However, he promised a “much more extensive” response in case of future attacks from the IDF.Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza begabn last October. West Jerusalem accused Tehran of masterminding the deadly raid on Israel that triggered the conflict, and of backing Hamas, Hezbollah, and other pro-Palestine militant groups in the region. Tehran denied involvement in the October attack but pledged to continue to support Hamas and other Palestinian groups.

        Israel to coordinate response to Iranian attack with allies – NYT

    
                    Tehran has warned West Jerusalem against retaliation, vowing a “much more extensive” pushback
            FILE PHOTO. ©                 AP Photo/Ariel SchalitIsrael intends to coordinate its response to the recent massive Iranian drone and missile attack with its allies, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Sunday, citing sources.However, an unnamed Israeli official would not disclose to the NYT when and with whom West Jerusalem would hold those consultations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already spoken by phone with US President Joe Biden since Iran's overnight strikes. The US leader reaffirmed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel” and hailed the country’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”Biden also said that he would hold talks with G7 leaders “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” adding that the US would stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders. Several Western nations have strongly condemned Tehran’s strikes.

At the same time, Axios reported US officials as saying Biden told Netanyahu that Washington would not support an Israeli tit-for-tat response out of concern it could trigger an all-out regional war. The Times of Israel reported that West Jerusalem had yet to decide on how and whether it should respond to the attack.Meanwhile, Iran announced the end of the operation, saying that it was meant as “punishment” for what Tehran believes was an Israeli attack on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month, which killed several senior Iranian military officers.However, Iran warned Israel that any retaliatory measures would be met with a “much more extensive” pushback.The weekend raid involved more than 300 Iranian missiles and drones, according to Israeli officials, who have claimed 99% of the projectiles were intercepted. At the same time, Iran has assessed the attack as even more successful than expected, claiming to have destroyed two Israeli facilities.

Iranian attack on Israel

        Israel strikes ‘deep inside’ Lebanon

    
                    The attack came in response to missiles fired toward the northern part of the Jewish state overnight, according to the IDF
            ©                 Telegram/idfofficialIsrael has reported launching airstrikes deep into Lebanese territory, targeting Hezbollah positions across the country as tensions in the region soared after Iran attacked Israel over the weekend.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted to its Telegram channel footage of one of the attacks, stating that it shows fighter jets striking a “significant” Hezbollah weapons manufacturing site in the area of Nabi Chit, close to the Syrian border. The IDF also reported having bombed a number of military structures belonging to Hezbollah in the area of Jbaa in southern Lebanon, as well as the group’s infrastructure and outposts in several other areas.According to the Israeli military, the attacks came in response to missiles being fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel overnight in the areas of Kfar Blum and Hanita. No injuries were reported in those strikes.Earlier on Sunday, Hezbollah admitted it had joined in the Iranian drone and missile attack against Israel and twice launched airstrikes towards the occupied Golan Heights. Tehran’s attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian military officials. Tehran has blamed the attack on Israel.Iran-backed Hezbollah, a pro-Palestinian militant group and one of the most influential political factions in Lebanon, has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces since the start of the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza last October.

According to AFP estimates, at least 363 people in Lebanon have been killed in the hostilities so far, including at least 70 civilians, while tens of thousands of people have reportedly fled their homes on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.Hezbollah will only stop its attacks on Israel after a ceasefire is reached in Gaza, emphasising that the front is largely a “supportive” one, the group’s senior politician Hassan Fadlallah said in late February.

        Trump blames Biden for Iranian attack on Israel

    
                    The Republican frontrunner for November’s presidential election has accused the incumbent of showing “unbelievable” weakness
            Donald Trump speaks at a rally outside Schnecksville Fire Hall on April 13, 2024 in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania. ©                 Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden bears part of the blame for Iran’s massive drone and missile strike on Israel on Saturday, former US president and current Republican frontrunner for the November race Donald Trump has claimed. The GOP firebrand suggested that a lack of leadership on the part of the Democratic incumbent has emboldened Tehran.Late on Saturday, Iran launched several waves of missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel. Tehran explained that the strikes were retaliation for the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”What was believed to be an Israeli airstrike destroyed Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.While Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari has reported that the vast majority of the projectiles fired by Iran this weekend were intercepted by air defenses, Iranian state media has claimed that several Israeli military installations were struck.Addressing supporters in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump said that the Iranian strikes took place “because we show great weakness.”

“The weakness that we’ve shown, it’s unbelievable, and it would not have happened if we were in office,” he suggested.He concluded by reiterating his “absolute support” for Israel.Trump has also posted several similar messages on his Truth Social platform, such as one saying: “This should never have been allowed to happen - This would NEVER have happened if I were President!”Trump has previously accused his Democratic rival of not being assertive enough globally and has repeatedly alleged that Biden is unfit for office.An unabashed supporter of Israel, Trump during his time in office recognized Syria’s Golan Heights, which have been occupied for decades, as Israeli territory. He also officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the US embassy there from Tel Aviv in 2018.Speaking on Wednesday in Atlanta, he told reporters that President Biden had “abandoned Israel.”Although continuing to support Israel, Biden has of late been increasingly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign against Hamas.In an interview to MSNBC last month, Biden suggested that the Israeli prime minister was committing a “big mistake” with his hardline approach.Biden pointed out, however, that Washington was “never going to leave Israel” and would keep providing it with weaponry no matter what.

            ©                 X/Israel Defense ForcesThe Israeli military appears to have inserted seven-year-old footage of a Russian Grad launch into a purported compilation showing the Iranian missile and drone strikes launched against the Jewish state over the weekend.The video, posted on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption “Israelis’ reality in the last hours,” has raised many eyebrows online.While most fragments of the footage show missiles flying over Israeli territory overnight, the final several seconds have nothing to do with either Israel or Iran but rather appear to be footage of the launch of a Russian Grad rocket system that was posted on YouTube back in 2017.The discrepancy was noticed by X user Mohammed Zubair, who voiced his protest in a post and suggested that the fragment may in fact be as old as 2014.The IDF has not responded to the user’s claim.The last part of the video is as old as 2014. 👋🏽 pic.twitter.com/7BMVRKp82i— Mohammed Zubair (@zoo_bear) April 14, 2024Netizens have been divided on Zubair’s findings, with some praising his fact-checking skills, while others pointed to the fact that the IDF clip is more motivational in nature and does not claim to be official footage.Tehran fired a barrage of more than 300 missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel overnight on Saturday, according to estimates by the IDF. The attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria earlier this month that killed several high-ranking Iranian military officials. Tehran blamed the attack on Israel.The majority of Iran’s missiles were said to have been shot down before they reached Israeli airspace. However, unverified footage of the airstrikes circulating online purportedly showing several projectiles hitting targets on the ground in Israel.

The Times of Israel reported that West Jerusalem has yet to decide on whether to respond to the Iranian attack or how it would do so. However, Tehran warned Israel earlier against taking any retaliatory measures, as they would be met with a “much more extensive” response.

        Russia tells Israel to condemn Ukraine

    
                    Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made the remark after West Jerusalem’s envoy urged Moscow to denounce Iranian strikes
            Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. ©                 Sputnik/Stanislav KrasilnikovRussia does not feel obliged to condemn Iran’s missile and drone strikes on Israel on Saturday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said. The diplomat explained that West Jerusalem has never denounced Ukraine’s attacks on Russian civilians.According to Israeli estimates, Tehran’s latest show of force involved hundreds of rockets and missiles, as well as kamikaze UAVs. Iran announced that the strike was in response to the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”A presumed Israeli airstrike hit Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.Iranian state media has claimed that a number of Israeli military facilities were struck in Saturday’s attack. The Israeli military, in turn, has insisted that its air defenses shot down nearly all of the incoming projectiles.In a post on her Telegram channel on Sunday, Zakharova addressed the Israeli Ambassador to Russia, Simona Halperin, who had earlier told RIA Novosti that her country expects “our Russian colleagues to condemn the unprecedented Iranian attack on Israeli territory.”

The Israeli envoy also expressed hope that Moscow would counter “Iran’s attempts to destabilize the region.”Zakharova responded: “Simona, remind me of when Israel condemned even a single strike by the Kiev regime on Russian regions? You don’t know? Nor do I.”The foreign ministry representative also cited “regular statements in support of [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky’s actions on the part of Israeli officials.”In another statement on Sunday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that Moscow is “deeply concerned with another dangerous escalation in the region.”“We call on all parties involved to exercise restraint. We hope that regional states will solve existing problems through political and diplomatic means,” the ministry added.Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza broke out last October. Israeli authorities claimed that Tehran orchestrated the deadly Hamas incursion that triggered the conflict.Iran has denied involvement, but pledged to keep backing the Palestinian cause.

        Israeli general reveals cost of defending against attack – media

    
                    The operation reportedly required upward of $1.3 billion worth of interceptor missiles and other materials to bring down Iran’s aerial barrages
            ©                 Sara Lemel/picture alliance via Getty ImagesIsrael has claimed success in defending itself against Saturday’s drone and missile barrages by Iran, but that effort reportedly came at a high price.The interceptors, jet fuel and other materials expended in shooting down Iran’s unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missiles cost about 4-to-5 billion shekels ($1.06 billion to $1.33 billion), Israeli Brigadier General Reem Aminoach told local media outlet Ynet News on Sunday. The estimate included only Israel’s direct costs, not counting the considerable weaponry used by the US and other allies in helping to defend against the attack.Aminoach, formerly the financial adviser to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff, said West Jerusalem used such munitions as Arrow and David’s Sling interceptor missiles, which have per-unit costs of about $3.5 million and $1 million, respectively. He also included sortie expenses for the fighter jets that did the bulk of the work in shooting down Iranian drones.

The general lamented that it was far cheaper for Iran to launch the attack than for Israel to defend itself. “The attack cost Iran less than 10% of what it cost us to defend against it,” he told Ynet. “In the future – in a year, two years, or five years – they can carry out 50 such attacks. And let’s say that if the IDF’s net budget in 2023 was 60 billion shekels, with less than double that you have no chance of reaching a situation where we can maintain the required amounts.”The IDF claimed that 99% of the more than 300 kamikaze drones and missiles launched from Iranian territory were successfully intercepted. All of the UAVs and cruise missiles were shot down, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said, while a few ballistic missiles got through Israel’s defenses.Those projectiles fell at the Nevatim Airbase and caused “only minor damage to infrastructure,” the spokesman said. He added that the drones launched by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and Yemen all failed to reach Israeli territory. The only casualty was a shrapnel wound to a 10-year-old Bedouin Israeli girl who was hit while sleeping at her home in southern Israel.

        Netanyahu called off retaliation strikes after speaking to Biden – NYT

    
                    The US president reportedly talked the Israeli prime minister out of military action against Iran
            Joe Biden (L) meets with Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023 ©                 AFP / Brendan SmialowskiIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a plan to launch immediate retaliatory strikes against Iran after speaking to US President Joe Biden by phone on Saturday night, Israeli officials have told the New York Times.According to two anonymous officials, Netanyahu’s war cabinet presented him with a list of responses to a massive drone and missile attack by Iran on Saturday evening. While some members of the cabinet reportedly pushed for an immediate military response, Netanyahu ultimately chose not to follow their advice at Biden’s request, the sources said.The full details of Biden’s conversation with Netanyahu were not revealed by the White House. According to a report on Sunday by Axios, however, Biden told Netanyahu that Israel had essentially prevailed in this clash with Iran and advised him to “take the win.” It was also made clear during the call that any retaliatory action by Israel would not be supported by Washington, the American outlet reported.

‘Punishment’ of Israel completed – Tehran



Netanyahu’s war cabinet met on Sunday afternoon to discuss Israel’s response to the Iranian attack, while Iran’s top military commander declared that the “Zionist regime” had been adequately “punished,” and that Tehran would not pursue further military action unless Israel struck again.Iran launched multiple waves of missiles and kamikaze drones at Israel on Saturday, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stating that at least 300 projectiles were fired. While the IDF claimed to have shot down 99% of the incoming drones and missiles, video footage showed numerous impacts on Israeli soil.Iranian officials insisted that they had “more success than expected” with the barrage, and claimed that two Israeli bases had been destroyed. The IDF acknowledged only minor damage to one military facility.

The attack came two weeks after an alleged Israeli airstrike hit an Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital of Damascus. The strike killed seven officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals. Tehran telegraphed its response, with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning for over a week that Israel could expect a “slap in the face.”

        Iran is ‘greatest threat’ to world order – Israel

    
                    West Jerusalem has called for “painful sanctions” in response to Saturday’s drone and missile barrages
            Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz speaks at a UN Security Council meeting last month in New York.  © Getty Images /                 John LamparskiThe Israeli Foreign Ministry has responded to Saturday’s Iranian attack by condemning Tehran as the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace.Iran should be hit with “painful sanctions,” as well as designation of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, following the overnight attack, the ministry said on Sunday in a statement. Tehran launched hundreds of suicide drones and missiles at Israel in retaliation for an April 1 airstrike that killed seven IRGC officers at the Iranian consulate in Damascus.“Iran launched a large-scale and unprecedented attack against the state of Israel, which included hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles,” the Foreign Ministry said. “This attack once again proves what Israel has been saying for years: Iran is behind terrorist attacks in the region and is also the greatest threat to regional stability and world order, which is why Iran should never acquire nuclear weapons.”New sanctions against Iran should not be limited to the country’s missile industry, the ministry said. “Iran must pay the price for its aggression, and the first step in this direction must be immediate recognition of the Iranian IRGC – which carried out this large-scale terrorist attack against Israel – as a terrorist organization.”

Netanyahu called off retaliation strikes after speaking to Biden – NYT



Foreign Minister Israel Katz resuscitated an old phrase coined by former US President George W. Bush to express his outrage, saying, “The entire free world must stand with Israel against the axis of Iranian evil.”Israel may be trying to use a diplomatic offensive to punish Iran after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly urged by US President Joe Biden to cancel retaliatory strikes against Tehran. At Biden’s request, Netanyahu chose to reject calls from some members of his war cabinet for an immediate military response, the New York Times reported, citing two unidentified Israeli officials.Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN justified Saturday’s attack by citing its legitimate right of self-defense under Article 51 of the global body’s charter. “The matter can be deemed concluded,” the mission said in a statement, referring to the retribution for Israel’s strike against its Damascus consulate.Tehran has no intention of taking further action, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff for Iran’s military, said on Sunday. However, he warned that if Israel strikes again in response to Saturday’s attack, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

The Israeli military claimed that 99% of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched from Iranian territory were successfully intercepted. The few that got through Israel’s defenses caused only minor infrastructure damage at the Nevatim Airbase. Only one person, a ten-year-old Bedouin Israeli girl, was injured.

        Zelensky backs Israel

    
                    The Ukrainian president has likened Iran’s tactics to those of Russia, accusing Tehran of threatening the Middle East
            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ©                 PETRAS MALUKAS / AFPUkrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has condemned Iran’s missile and drone strikes against Israel on Saturday, drawing parallels between Tehran’s actions and Russia’s tactics in Ukraine.Iran said the barrage was in retaliation for the “Zionist regime’s numerous crimes, including the attack on the consular section of Iran’s Embassy in Damascus.”A presumed Israeli airstrike destroyed Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria on April 1, killing seven officers of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, including two high-ranking generals.According to Iranian state media, Saturday’s strikes hit a number of Israeli military facilities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that its air defenses intercepted nearly all of the incoming projectiles.In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, President Zelensky wrote that “Ukraine condemns Iran’s attack on Israel.” The Ukrainian head of state added that his compatriots “know very well the horror of similar attacks by Russia, which uses the same Shahed drones and Russian missiles, the same tactics of mass air strikes.”

Kiev and its Western backers have repeatedly claimed that Iran has been providing Russia with its kamikaze UAVs, and that Moscow has begun producing them under license. Russia has never confirmed these allegations.Iran, however, did acknowledge in November 2022 that it had supplied Moscow with a “small number” of drones a few months before Russia began its operation in Ukraine.In his latest statement, Zelensky accused Iran of posing a threat to the Middle East, claiming that there is “obvious collaboration” between Tehran and Moscow.According to the Ukrainian leader, Iranian strikes on Israel on Saturday should serve as a “wake-up call to the free world,” which needs to deliver a “resolute and united response.”In a thinly veiled reference to the political deadlock in the US that has seen Republican lawmakers block President Joe Biden’s foreign defense aid package for months now, Zelensky urged the US Congress to “make the necessary decisions to strengthen America’s allies at this critical time.”Meanwhile, Russia’s Foreign Ministry expressed concern over “another dangerous escalation in the region” and urged “all parties involved to exercise restraint.”Responding to a call by Israel’s ambassador in Russia, Simona Halperin, to condemn Tehran’s actions, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova pointed out that Israel has never once denounced Ukrainian strikes targeting Russian civilians.On the contrary, Israeli officials have repeatedly expressed support for Kiev, the diplomat noted, suggesting that Moscow therefore has no reason to stick up for Israel.

Iranian attack on Israel

        Western demands for UN to discuss Iran attack are ‘hypocrisy’ – Moscow

    
                    Failure to condemn the Israeli bombing of Tehran’s consulate in Syria spurred the latest violence, Russia’s ambassador has argued
            Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia ©                 Lev Radin / Pacific Press / LightRocket via Getty ImagesThe UN Security Council helped give rise to Saturday’s Iranian attack against Israel by hypocritically failing to take action over the illegal bombing that provoked the latest violence in the region, Russia’s ambassador to the global body has claimed.“What happened on the night of April 14 did not happen in a vacuum,” Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told members of the UN Security Council on Sunday. “The steps undertaken by Iran became a reaction to the disgraceful inaction by this council.”At issue was the April 1 missile strike that killed seven Iranian military officers, including two senior commanders, at Tehran’s consulate in Damascus. Western members of the Security Council stood in the way of rebuking Israel over the “egregious attack,” despite the fact that it was a violation of international law on the inviolability of diplomatic installations, the Russian envoy said.“We called on UN Security Council colleagues to clearly and unequivocally condemn such reckless steps to make sure that they don’t get repeated,” Nebenzia noted. “We also warned that otherwise, the risk of a repeat of such acts and a general escalation in the region would grow manifold.” He added, “The outcome is now clear for everyone to see.”

Iran launched hundreds of suicide drones and missiles against Israel on Saturday night. West Jerusalem claimed success in intercepting 99% of the barrages and preventing major casualties or infrastructure damage.The Israeli Foreign Ministry responded by calling for “painful sanctions” against Iran, as well as the designation of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. An emergency UN Security Council session was convened to discuss the attack.Nebenzia contrasted the council’s concern over protecting Western nations and their allies with its inaction when Israel bombed Iran’s consulate. “We know very well that an attack against a diplomatic representation is a casus belli under international law. And if a Western representation had been hit, you would immediately have rained down reprisals.”

However, he added, “when it comes to other countries, their rights – including the right to self-defense – well, that’s a different matter, as you like to say… What we’re witnessing is a display of hypocrisy and double standards that is almost embarrassing to watch.”The US, UK, and France essentially declined to confirm that the basic principles of international law concerning diplomatic facilities apply equally to all states, Nebenzia said. At the same time, Israel has faced no consequences for disregarding UN resolutions, including last month’s demand for a ceasefire in Gaza.“We think it’s urgent for the entire international community to undertake all efforts necessary to deescalate the situation,” the ambassador said. “Otherwise, the region could be drawn into a vicious cycle of mutual attacks and violence.”

Iranian attack on Israel

        Middle East on verge of full-scale war – UN

    
                    Antonio Guterres has condemned both the bombing of the Iranian consulate and Tehran’s retaliation against Israel
            UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at an emergency UNSC session, New York, April 14, 2024. ©                 UN Photo/Eskinder DebebeUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged for maximum restraint, warning that the entire Middle East is on the brink of a full-scale war in the wake of Iran’s drone and missile strike on Israel this weekend.The attack came in retaliation for an airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month, which killed seven members of Iran’s military, including two generals. Tehran accused West Jerusalem of conducting an extraterritorial assassination. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel strikes its “enemies all over the Middle East,” two days after the April 1 consulate strike.The entire region is facing a devastating conflict after these events, Guterres warned. “Now is the time to defuse and deescalate,” he said, urging “maximum restraint.”

While he “strongly condemned” the large-scale attack on Israel, he also reiterated his condemnation of the bombing of Tehran’s consular buildings in Damascus earlier this month, calling for an “immediate cessation of these hostilities.”It’s time to step back from the brink. It’s vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East.Guterres also urged for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, where over 33,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes over the past six months, according to local health officials. West Jerusalem declared war and vowed to annihilate the Gaza-based militant group Hamas after it conducted a surprise raid on Israeli soil, killing more than 1,100 people and taking around 250 hostages. The UN has previously warned that the deteriorating humanitarian situation and inadequate flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza is leading to starvation among the displaced civilian population of the enclave.

The UN chief called for the unconditional release of all hostages, unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and the reestablishment of safe navigation in the Red Sea, which is currently hampered by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The group has been attacking shipping in the region in solidarity with the Palestinians, vowing to continue until the Gaza siege is broken.With “regional and indeed global peace and security” undermined, Guterres said, “neither the region nor the world can afford more war.”

        Israel shows aftermath of Iranian attack on airbase (VIDEO)

    
                    Only a few of more than 300 projectiles launched by Tehran made it through Israeli defenses, the IDF has said
            © YouTube /                 Youtube /  עדכוני צה""לThe Iranian airstrikes on Israel at the weekend caused only minor damage to one military base, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has claimed, releasing footage purporting to show repair work at the facility.Tehran launched a series of airstrikes against Israel over the weekend, in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria earlier this month. West Jerusalem has not commented on the consular attack, although Tehran has accused it of assassinating several of its high-ranking military personnel.Of the roughly 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles launched from Iran at the weekend, only a few made it through the combined air defenses of Israel and its allies, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press release on Sunday.The ballistic missiles that breached Israeli defenses dealt “only minor damage to the infrastructure at the Nevatim base,” the IDF wrote on its website, posting footage purporting to show the damage and subsequent repair work.“The function of Nevatim base was not affected, the planes continued to take off and land and fulfill the defense and attack missions,” it added.

As many as nine missiles penetrated Israeli defenses, ABC News wrote, citing a senior US official. Five ballistic missiles hit the Nevatim Airbase and damaged a C-130 transport plane, a runway and empty storage facilities, the channel said. Four more missiles hit the Negev Airbase, although no significant damage was done, the official told ABC.Iranian media, however, claimed the strikes destroyed “important military targets,” and published multiple videos purporting to show missiles penetrating Israeli air defenses. Tehran is satisfied with the outcome and has no intention of continuing the operation, chief of staff of the armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, said. He warned that if Israel retaliates, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

        Israel weighing response to Iranian attack – IDF

    
                    Countermeasures could involve a “strike or no strike,” a military spokesperson had said, according to ABC
            Israeli war cabinet meeting, Tel Aviv, Israel, April 14, 2024  © Getty Images /                 Israeli Ministry of Defense / Handout/Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe Israeli military has presented a range of options to the government on how to respond to the recent Iranian airstrikes, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Peter Lerner told journalists on Monday, as reported by ABC news.  Tehran launched several waves of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles at Israel over the weekend, in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. The strike on the consulate – which West Jerusalem has neither confirmed nor denied – killed seven members of the Iranian military, including two high-ranking generals.  Iran has said its retaliatory operation destroyed two Israeli military bases, although the IDF claimed it intercepted 99% of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched at the country, admitting only “minor damage” to Nevatim Airbase.

“Just because we were successful in intercepting, we should not underestimate what Iran did,” Lerner said. The Israeli government is “currently reviewing the options” after the “IDF has presented what it believes could be done,” ABC quoted the spokesman as saying. The response could entail a “strike or no strike” Lerner stated, adding that the government could make a decision as early as Monday.  Despite “emotions running high” among the Israeli leadership following the airstrikes, US President Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to show restraint in an effort to avoid further military escalation, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing a senior administration official. Iran has warned that a military response would prompt an even bigger escalation. Tehran sees its airstrikes as a success and has “no intention of continuing the operation,” Iran’s chief of staff of the armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, announced on Sunday. He warned that if Israel responds with force, “the next operation will be much more extensive.”

        Iranian media names weapons used to strike Israel (VIDEO, PHOTOS)

    
                    The attack reportedly relied heavily on Shahed-136 drones and several types of advanced long-range missiles
            A handout picture provided by Iran's Defence Ministry on May 25, 2023, shows the testing of the fourth generation Khorramshahr ballistic missile. ©                 IRANIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY / AFPIran used kamikaze drones and several types of long-range ballistic missiles to launch a wave of strikes on Israel over the weekend, local media has reported.According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran’s powerful attack on Israel involved 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles. The strikes came in retaliation for what Iran claims was an Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, early this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead.While the Iranian military provided few details about what weapons were used in the attack, local media suggested that it employed many of its advanced systems to target its arch-enemy.According to Press TV, the drone and missile raid was preceded by cyberattacks on Israel’s radar and power grid systems, causing outages.The outlet, along with Mehr News agency, said that the air attack involved dozens Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. The aircraft, which has also been characterized as a loitering munition, has delta-shaped wings and is difficult for radars to detect due to its low signature. It has a range of 2,000km and can carry a payload of up to 50kg.The drone swarms were apparently followed by several types of missiles. Press TV reported that Iran likely used an unknown number of Kheibar Shekan medium-range ballistic missiles with a payload of half a ton.

                   Fattah-2 hypersonic missile.     ©  Press TV / Telegram                                                        Mehr has also suggested that Iran used Khorramshahr-4 missiles with a range of 2,000km and a payload of 1,500kg. Meanwhile, Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iran’s military at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, argued that the strike also included Paveh 351 cruise missiles with a range of 1,650km.The New York Times reported the weapons used by Iran in the attack were much faster and more precise than those used by the Palestinian armed movement Hamas, which often relies on inaccurate missiles made of inferior materials.

However, Iran and Israel disagreed sharply on the results of the strike. While Iranian officials have said that the attack was even more successful than expected, claiming to have destroyed two Israeli bases, West Jerusalem insists that 99% of incoming targets were shot down.

        Israel mobilizes more reservists

    
                    Two additional brigades are being called up to fight in Gaza, the military has said
            FILE PHOTO: Israeli troops at the Gaza border. ©                 Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesIsrael will mobilize two additional brigades for operations in Gaza, the military announced on Sunday.More reservists are needed on the front line “to defend the State of Israel and ensure the security of its citizens,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement.The announcement came a week after Israel pulled most of its ground forces out of the Palestinian enclave, in what the military leadership described as preparation for a mission in the city of Rafah.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure from his coalition partners to send ground troops into the city on the Egyptian border, where some 1.3 million Palestinians are estimated to be crammed. The US, a key supplier of military aid to Israel, has expressed concerns that an operation in Rafah would cause significant civilian casualties.

Netanyahu brushes off US concerns over Rafah 



Members of the Israeli government, including Netanyahu, have maintained the Jewish state cannot achieve its primary stated goal of defeating the Palestinian militant group Hamas without entering Rafah.The announcement on Sunday came after Western assistance helped Israeli forces repel a barrage of Iranian drones and missiles. Tehran launched the attack in retaliation for an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus on April 1, which it blamed on Israel. The IDF claimed that together with its partners, it had had stopped some 99% of Iranian projectiles.Commenting on the Iranian attack, IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stressed that the Israeli military “has not lost sight” of its goals in Gaza. “Hamas and Iran want to ignite the Middle East and escalate the region,” he claimed.The ongoing hostilities in Gaza were triggered by a Hamas incursion into southern Israel in October, in which some 1,200 people were killed and dozens taken hostage. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed amid the Israeli retaliation, most of them women and children, according to local health authorities.

        China comments on Iran-Israel tensions

    
                    The “flames” of Israel’s war with Hamas are threatening to engulf the entire Middle East, Beijing’s ambassador to the UN has said

 
            China's deputy permanent representative to the U.N. Dai Bing. ©                 AP Photo/Yuki IwamuraIran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel constitute an “adverse spillover” of the Gaza conflict, China’s ambassador to the United Nations has said, warning that it could spread further and make the entire Middle East even more unstable.Dai Bing made the remarks after Tehran launched a series of airstrikes on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria, which killed seven military personnel, including two generals.Israel has not commented on the incident since Iran accused it of conducting an extraterritorial assassination.Speaking at a UN Security Council emergency meeting on Sunday, Dai condemned Israel’s “vicious attack,” which he described as a “grave violation of the UN Charter and international law, and a breach of the sovereignty of both Syria and Iran.”The war in Gaza “bears on the peace, stability and long-term security in the [Middle East] region,” he added, and called for an immediate end to the hostilities.Dai warned that if “the flames of the Gaza conflict are allowed to continue raging, the adverse spillover is set to spread still further” across the entire region.The Chinese envoy also called for “maximum calm and restraint” from Israel and Iran to prevent further escalations.

“Ultimately, there is no alternative to the full implementation of the two-state solution, the only way to end the vicious circle of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict once and for all,” Dai said.China has called on the international community, particularly countries with influence, to play a “constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” the ambassador added.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also warned at Sunday’s emergency meeting that the entire Middle East is on the brink of a full-scale war in the wake of Iran’s strike on Israel.Meanwhile, Russia’s ambassador to the global body, Vassily Nebenzia, told members of the UN Security Council that the retaliatory strike “did not happen in a vacuum.” He claimed that the West had helped give rise to Iran’s attack by failing to take action over the illegal bombing of Tehran’s consulate in Damascus that provoked the latest violence in the region.

        No Biden address on Israel-Iran escalation – Politico

    
                    The US president is keeping a “low profile” to discourage tensions, his aides have told the news outlet
            FILE PHOTO: US President Joe Biden. ©                 Anna Moneymaker / Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has avoided making a public statement on the Iranian attack on Israel at the weekend in a bid to reduce tensions and stave off potential domestic criticism over the Gaza war, Politico has reported.Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday, declaring it was “punishing” the Jewish state for striking Tehran’s consulate in Damascus earlier this month. Israel, which did not publicly claim credit for killing Iranian officers at the diplomatic compound, has claimed that along with its partners, it repelled some 99% of Iranian weapons.The US was among the nations to help defend Israel and has pledged continued support, although Biden did not comment publicly at the weekend in an effort to discourage further escalation in the Middle East, White House officials told Politico.“Putting the president behind the Resolute Desk turns up the temperature,” one source said. “That’s something to ideally avoid.”

Some Biden advisers hope that the Iranian attack could grant them a temporary reprieve from Democratic critics, who disagree with Washington’s response to the hostilities with Gaza, the report added. Israel launched a massive military operation in the Palestinian enclave in retaliation for an incursion by the militant movement Hamas last October which left more than 1,200 people dead.Pro-Palestinian voices in the US, particularly from younger and progressive voters, have accused Biden of failing to keep Israel in check. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 33,000 as a result of Israel’s bombardment, according to local health officials.Members of Biden’s reelection team are concerned that voter discontent could cost him swing states such as Michigan during the November election, Politico said. Over 100,000 people voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary race in the state in February, following a campaign to show the incumbent leader their anger with his Israel policy.

        Iran-Israel escalation is avoidable – Hungary

    
                    Budapest has said major global players must behave “responsibly” and assist in easing the tensions
            Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.  © Getty Images /                 AnadoluIt is possible to avoid a further escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote in a post on Facebook late on Sunday.Tehran launched a massive airstrike on Israel on Saturday in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. While Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement that Israel strikes “enemies all over the Middle East.” Iran has warned that Israel reacting militarily to its strikes would prompt an even bigger escalation, while West Jerusalem is reportedly weighing its options.Szijjarto said he had discussed the situation with his Russian and Emirati counterparts, Sergey Lavrov and Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, late on Sunday.“Based on our discussions, I see that we Hungarians are not the only ones eager to prevent the spread of the Middle East conflict… There is still a chance that a widespread escalation of the situation can be avoided. However, this will only be possible if all significant players in world politics behave responsibly in the coming period,” he stated.In a separate post, Szijjarto said that Budapest “strongly condemns” Iran’s missile attack on Israel, as it “threatens to escalate the conflict,” posing a serious threat to global security. He expressed those sentiments in a conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Sunday. He also said he made clear to his counterpart that Hungary opposes any further ramp up of tensions.

Iran’s diplomatic mission to the UN justified Saturday’s barrage as self-defense under Article 51 of the body’s charter. Tehran also said it has no intention of taking further action unless Israel strikes it again. The Israeli Foreign Ministry, however, condemned Tehran as the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace and called for “painful sanctions” against Iran, as well as the designation of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.

        ‘Time to be smart’ – UK on Israel-Iran tensions

    
                    British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he hoped there would be no “retaliatory response” to Iran’s attack
            UK Foreign Secretary and former Prime Minister David Cameron. ©                 Antonio Masiello/Getty ImagesIsrael has every right to retaliate after the Iranian drone and missile attack over the weekend but would be better served by refraining from an escalation, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said. The Iranian strikes, which Israeli officials say involved around 300 drones and missiles of various types, came in response to the bombing of an Iranian consular compound in Syria earlier this month that left several senior Iranian military officers dead. Iran believes that Israel was behind the strike, although West Jerusalem has neither claimed nor denied responsibility.In an interview with Sky News on Monday, Cameron, who served as UK prime minister between 2010 and 2016 and was appointed foreign secretary last year, described the Iranian strike as a “double defeat.” He argued that the attack “was almost a total failure, and they’ve revealed to the world that they are the malign influence in the region.”

Pointing to the scale of the attack, Cameron remarked: “Of course if you’re sitting in Israel this morning you’re thinking quite rightly – ‘We have every right to respond to this’… But we are urging that they shouldn’t escalate.”“I totally understand those in Israel who want to see more, but I think this is a time to think with head as well as heart and to be smart as well as tough,” he argued.Cameron added that he hoped there would be no “retaliatory response,” and that the world would shift its focus back to Hamas and the hostages that had been captured by the Palestinian armed group after it attacked Israel last year.Israeli officials claimed that the military shot down 99% of the incoming Iranian drones and missiles and that the attack did “only minor damage to the infrastructure at the Nevatim base.” Air force operations in the area were not affected, the officials added. Iran, however, has insisted that the barrage was more successful than expected, claiming that “important military targets” had been destroyed, and that Nevatim air base was rendered inoperable. Tehran said that it had no intention of continuing the attacks but warned Israel of a harsh response if it were to retaliate.CNN, citing sources, reported that Israel has so far made no decision on how to respond. One of the network’s sources noted that an Israeli official told the US that his country was not looking to escalate the standoff.

        Macron calls for ‘isolation’ of Iran

    
                    The French president has condemned Tehran’s attack on Israel and called for sanctions to be strengthened
            French President Emmanuel Macron.  © Getty Images /                 Christian Liewig - CorbisFrench President Emmanuel Macron has called for international sanctions on Iran to be strengthened following its attack on Israel over the weekend.Tehran carried out a massive airstrike on Israeli territory on Saturday in response to the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus earlier this month. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its role in the bombing, but its responsibility was later implied by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.In an interview to BFMTV and RMC radio, Macron condemned Iran’s response, calling it “disproportionate.”“Instead of targeting Israeli interests outside Israel, [Tehran] went after Israel on its soil, and attacked from their own soil, which is a first,” he said, noting that the airstrikes had caused “a profound rupture” in already strained relations between the two Middle Eastern states, paving the way for further “dangerous reactions” on both sides.Macron said the international community “will do everything to avoid escalation” in the conflict and urged Israel not to retaliate via military means. Instead, he said the focus should be on “isolating“ Iran and called for more sanctions on Tehran, including “boosting pressure on its nuclear activities,” which he believes would help “find a path to peace in the region.”Iran has justified Saturday’s attack by citing its right of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also pledged not to take further action, unless Israel strikes again, but warned that a military response from would prompt an even bigger escalation. Israel has called Iran the “greatest threat” to regional and world peace, and called for “painful sanctions” on Tehran, including its nuclear industry.

Iran has been the subject of various international sanctions for decades amid fears in the West that its nuclear enrichment program was aimed at producing a nuclear bomb. Sanctions were eased somewhat in 2015 when Tehran agreed to some restrictions on the program under the Iran Nuclear Deal, known officially as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran, the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the EU.However, the deal was scuppered in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and reimposed old sanctions on Tehran. Several attempts to revive the deal in recent years have proven unsuccessful.

        Iran calls on India to continue efforts to stop Gaza war

    
                    The two countries’ foreign ministers discussed the situation after Tehran launched its first direct attack on Israel
            Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian meets his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Tehran, Iran on January 15, 2024. ©                 Haydar Sahin/Getty ImagesIran has urged India to maintain an “active role” in efforts to halt the war in Gaza through international bodies, such as the United Nations Security Council. Discussing Tehran’s retaliatory attack on West Jerusalem with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian stressed “the imperative of ending the aggression and crimes committed by the Zionist regime.” Jaishankar spoke to his counterpart in Tehran following Iran’s drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an April 1 airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel’s attack killed several high-profile officers of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force.During his call with the Iranian foreign minister, Jaishakar stressed the importance of de-escalating and asked the parties “to assume responsibility and work towards a peaceful resolution.” In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s attack, New Delhi issued a statement calling for “immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence, and return to the path of diplomacy.”The diplomats also discussed the fate of the Indian crew members of the Israeli-operated vessel MSC Aries, which was seized by Iran in the Persian Gulf last week. Tehran has said it will allow New Delhi officials to meet the 17 sailors.

The Indian leadership has advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict while calling for both sides to engage in talks.Last October, India abstained on a UN General Assembly resolution that called for a truce as it did not mention Hamas’ attack. In December, however, New Delhi voted in favor of a resolution that demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages. Earlier this month, India abstained on a proposal at the UN’s Human Rights Council to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel. India’s push for de-escalation in the region stems from strategic, economic, and humanitarian concerns, Indian Express noted in a report. Around 18,000 Indians live in Israel and about 5,000-10,000 in Iran. At the same time, the number of Indians living, working, and studying in the Gulf countries exceeds nine million people, and a large-scale conflict could disrupt the lives of the diaspora.Moreover, the Middle East accounts for about 80% of India’s oil supplies, and a conflict could send energy prices soaring.

A regional war might also derail two ambitious transportation corridors that New Delhi considers vital for expanding its trade with Europe, Central Asia, and Russia. These are the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) connecting India with Russia and the CIS region via Iran – bypassing volatile parts of the Middle East – and the proposed India-Middle-East-Europe Economic corridor (EMEC) connecting India via the ports of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.  Where India Meets Russia – We are now on WhatsApp! ‎Follow and share RT India in English and in Hindi

        Kremlin comments on Iran’s strike on Israel

    
                    Moscow has urged both sides to exercise restraint, warning that escalation will benefit no one
            ©                 Alexander NEMENOV / AFPNo one would benefit from a conflict between Iran and Israel spiraling out of control, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, voicing hope that the two regional powers will be able to resolve their differences peacefully.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Peskov weighed in on a massive Iranian strike on Israel over the weekend, which West Jerusalem said involved more than 300 drones and missiles. The attack came in response to an alleged Israeli strike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month. The strike killed several senior Iranian military personnel.The Kremlin spokesman said that Russia is “extremely worried about escalating tensions in the region,” urging everyone to exercise restraint.“Further escalation serves no one’s interests. We advocate that all differences be resolved only by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov added.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has also said that regional tensions are being fueled by “the unresolved nature of numerous crises in the Middle East, primarily in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict zone.”It also deplored that the UN Security Council had been unable to “adequately react” to the bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria – which Iran insists was the reason for its strike in the first place – due to the stance of Western powers on the issue.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rejected Israel’s call to condemn Iran’s attack, saying that West Jerusalem had not denounced Ukrainian strikes on Russian regions, and that it regularly provides vocal diplomatic support for Kiev.In the aftermath of the barrage, Iran declared the end of its military operation against Israel, warning the Jewish state of harsh pushback if it were to retaliate.Numerous reports indicate that the US wants Israel to exercise caution, which has yet to make a decision on whether to respond. CNN reported, citing an Israeli official, that Netanyahu’s government told the US it is not looking to significantly escalate the situation. However, according to Reuters, the Israeli war cabinet favors retaliation but is divided over its timing and scope.
