Washington
CNN
         — 
    


            The US expects that Iran will carry out strikes against multiple targets inside Israel in the coming days and is prepared to help intercept any weapons launched at its ally, sources tell CNN, as the Biden administration is on high alert for what could be the eruption of a significantly volatile and unpredictable period in the Middle East.
    

President Joe Biden on Friday predicted that Iran’s attacks were coming “sooner than later” and sought to once again issue a stern public warning, saying that his message to Tehran was simply: “Don’t.”
    

            The beginning of a state-on-state conflict between Iran and Israel would mark a serious escalation in the region – a scenario that the US has hoped to avoid since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.
    

            As of late Friday, the US believed that Iranian proxies could also be involved in the forthcoming attacks, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the intelligence, and that targets would likely be both inside Israel and around the region. The US’ readiness to intercept weapons launched at Israel marked a clear indication of the level of ongoing cooperation between the two militaries.
    

            The US had observed Iran moving military assets around internally, including drones and cruise missiles, signaling that it was preparing to attack Israeli targets from inside its own territory, according to two people familiar with US intelligence. One of the people said that the US had observed Iran readying as many as 100 cruise missiles.
    

            It was not clear whether Iran was preparing to strike from its soil as part of an initial attack, or if it was posturing to try to deter Israel or the US from conducting a possible counter strike on its territory.
    

            At the White House Friday, Biden — responding to shouted questions from reporters including whether US troops were at risk — emphasized his administration’s commitment to Israel’s security.
    

            “We are devoted to the defense of Israel,” he said. “We will support Israel we will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed.”
    

            There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said Friday, following Israel’s attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria last week that killed three Iranian generals.
    

            Biden, who warned this week that Iran was threatening a “significant attack” on Israel, has been receiving constant updates on the situation from his national security team.
    

            The US and several other countries, including Britain and France, issued new travel guidelines for government employees in Israel as the Iranian threat loomed.
    

            “We’re watching this very, very closely,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, who declined to provide information about the expected timing of the threat.
    

            US Navy forces in the Red Sea have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen towards Israel. US forces in Iraq and Syria could also potentially intercept drones and rockets targeting northern Israel, depending on the location from which they’re launched.
    

            The Defense Department is also moving additional assets to the Middle East region “to bolster regional deterrence efforts and increase force protection for US forces,” a US defense official told CNN, as Israel and the US brace for a potential Iranian attack.
    

            The Pentagon has been working specifically to bolster air defenses for the US troops stationed in Iraq and Syria who came under attack by Iran-backed proxy forces over 100 times between October and February. In January, three US servicemembers were killed when a drone got through US air defenses at the Tower 22 base in Jordan.
    

            The US is not anticipating that Iran or its proxies will attack US forces as part of its retaliation but is moving the assets just in case.
    

            “It would be imprudent if we didn’t take a look at our own posture in the region to make sure that we’re properly prepared,” Kirby said.
    

            CNN reported last week that the US was on high alert and actively preparing for an attack by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region. Officials said such an attack could come within the week.
    

    Sources say Iran wary of dramatic escalation


            CNN reported earlier this week that an Iranian attack on Israel would likely be carried out by Iranian proxy forces in the region rather than by Iran directly, according to two people familiar with US intelligence on the matter.
    

            Tehran is wary of a dramatic escalation in the fighting, the sources said, and does not want to give the US or its allies an excuse to attack Iran directly.
    

            The sources said Iran and its proxy militia groups do not appear poised to attack US troops or other assets in the region, but they noted that Iran does not have perfect command and control over all its proxy forces, so the possibility of an attack on US assets cannot be completely ruled out.
    

            The sources told CNN that US intelligence assesses that Iran has urged several of its proxy militia groups to simultaneously launch a large-scale attack against Israel, using drones and missiles, and that they could attack as soon as this week.
    

            “The threat is very clear and credible,” said one of the sources. “They have put the pieces in place to conduct the attack now. Just waiting for the right time.”
    

            Biden spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about the threat of an Iranian attack during a telephone call last week.
    

            A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East. Such a strike could lead to the Israel-Hamas war broadening into a wider, regional conflict – something Biden has long sought to avoid.
    

            Biden is receiving briefings multiple times a day on the situation, Kirby said.
    

            Kirby said Friday that US officials were in “constant communication” with their Israeli counterparts about the matter and that steps were underway to ensure Israel is able to defend itself.
    

            “We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel,” Kirby said Friday.
    

            He pointed to a visit to Israel on Friday by US Central Command chief Gen. Erik Kurilla to have “those conversations directly with his IDF counterparts.”
    

            Kurilla’s trip to Israel was moved up because of the expectation of an Iranian response to Israel’s targeting of the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria last week.
    

            There have also been a number of conversations in which US officials have urged Israel not to escalate the situation in retaliating against Iran, according to one of the US officials said.
    

            Separately, US officials were frustrated with their Israeli counterparts over the lack of information Israel shared prior to carrying out the strike in Damascus last week, sources told CNN. Israel only informed a US official when its planes were already in the air en route to Syria, another US official said.
    

            “We were not aware that Israel was going to carry out this airstrike in advance,” the official said. “Minutes before it happened and when Israeli planes were already in the air, Israel reached out to a U.S. official to say they were in the process of conducting a strike in Syria. It did not include any details on who they were targeting or where it would be conducted, and the strike was already underway before word could be passed through the U.S. government.”
    

    Diplomatic pressure


            Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the foreign ministers of Turkey, China and Saudi Arabia to urge them to press Iran not to escalate the conflict in the Middle East after threats made by Iran against Israel, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Thursday.
    

            Miller said the US has also “engaged with European allies and partners over the past few days” to deliver a similar message on Iran. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron have both spoken to the Iranian foreign minister in recent days.
    

            Blinken “has been making clear to every country that has any semblance of a relationship with Iran that it is in their interest to use that relationship to send a message to Iran that they should not escalate this conflict. But I will let those countries speak for themselves about what action they may or may not take,” Miller said.
    

            The US State Department has restricted the travel of US government personnel in Israel in the wake of public threats against Israel by Iran.
    

            “Out of an abundance of caution, U.S. government employees and their family members are restricted from personal travel outside the greater Tel Aviv (including Herzliya, Netanya, and Even Yehuda), Jerusalem, and Be’er Sheva areas until further notice,” a security alert posted by the US Embassy Thursday said, “U.S. government personnel are authorized to transit between these three areas for personal travel.”
    

            “The security environment remains complex and can change quickly depending on the political situation and recent events,” the alert noted.
    

            France has advised its citizens to “absolutely refrain” from traveling to Iran, Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories due to the risk of “military escalation,” the French Foreign Ministry said Friday.
    

            The ministry added that families of diplomatic staff in the Iranian capital Tehran will be returned to France and civil servants will be banned from work missions to those countries and territories.
    

            The French foreign minister issued the new recommendation following a crisis meeting on the region, the ministry said in a post on X.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and US Central Command Commander Gen. Erik Kurilla on Friday discussed preparations for the potential attack. Warnings amid Iranian threats: France, Germany, Canada and the United States are among countries that are warning their citizens not to travel to the region due to the threat of an Iranian attack against Israel. Humanitarian aid: The Israeli military does not understand how humanitarian operations work, a top United Nations official said Friday, maintaining there is a ""degree of mistrust"" that needs to be resolved between the IDF and nongovernmental organizations on the ground in Gaza.Sanctions: The European Council has adopted sanctions against three Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad entities, in light of ""their responsibilities in the brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks"" that occurred across Israel on October 7. The US is also sanctioning four leaders of Hamas’ cyber and drone operations based in Gaza and Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced on Friday. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link5:33 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024US will attempt to intercept launches at Israel if feasible, US officials sayFrom CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha BertrandThe US will attempt to intercept any weapons launched at Israel if it’s feasible to do so, two US officials told CNN, in an indication of the level of ongoing cooperation between the two militaries before an anticipated Iranian attack.US Navy forces in the Red Sea have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched from the Houthis in Yemen toward Israel. US forces in Iraq and Syria could also potentially intercept drones and rockets targeting northern Israel, depending on the location from which they’re launched.Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, has been in Israel meeting with the country’s security leadership. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, met with Kurilla.There have been a number of conversations where US officials have urged Israel not to escalate the situation in retaliating against Iran, according to one of the US officials. Remember: An Iranian attack is expected in response to Israel’s deadly strike of Tehran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, last week.The Damascus attack was the latest incident to stoke fears of a wider regional conflict breaking out in the Middle East during Israel's campaign in Gaza.Diplomatic efforts: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held a slew of calls to foreign counterparts aimed at pressuring Iran not to attack Israel.The top US diplomat spoke with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on Friday, according to a readout from State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.Blinken also spoke with the Turkish, Chinese and Saudi foreign ministers in recent days, Miller said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link9:25 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Israeli settlers kill at least 1 Palestinian while storming West Bank villageFrom CNN’s Kareem Khadder and Zeena Saifi in Jerusalem and CNN’s Benjamin Brown in LondonA view of damaged houses and burning vehicles after a raid by Israeli settlers on a town near Ramallah, West Bank on April 12. Issam Rimawi/Anadolu/Getty ImagesHundreds of armed Israeli settlers stormed a village in the occupied West Bank on Friday, setting fire to several homes and cars in one of the largest attacks by settlers this year, according to Palestinian officials. At least one Palestinian man was killed when shots were fired by Israeli settlers in the village of Al-Mughayyir, east of Ramallah, according to the head of the village council Amin Abu-Alia. He said he identified the killed Palestinian as his 26-year-old relative named Jihad Abu-Alia, who was meant to get married this summer.At least 25 others were injured in the rampage, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, the scale of which has not been seen since hundreds of settlers stormed through the villages of Turmusayya and Huwara in two separate incidents last year. Between 1,000 and 1,200 settlers surrounded the village, and around 500 stormed it just after midday local time on Friday, blocking all the roads in the area, Abu-Alia told CNN. He added that Israeli security forces informed Palestinian officials that the settlers were looking for a 14-year-old Israeli boy who had gone missing earlier in the day.They attacked the village, raided homes and fired gunshots at residents, Abu-Alia said. Videos obtained by CNN show parts of the village burning, with smoke billowing over several buildings and settlers lobbing rocks. Houses and cars are seen completely burnt up, with sounds of gunfire and clashes heard in the background.According to Abu-Alia, the Israeli military arrived at the scene at around 3 p.m. and didn’t stop the settlers from attacking the village. Israeli soldiers allowed them to raid homes, prevented Palestinian residents from moving around and blocked ambulances from reaching the injured, he added.  Abu-Alia told CNN settlers stole approximately 70 sheep from the Palestinian village.In response to a question by CNN, the IDF said “violent riots were instigated in multiple locations in the area” following the search for the boy.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3:48 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Israel says airstrikes targeted Hezbollah targets in southern LebanonIsraeli warplanes carried out several airstrikes on Friday, targeting ""military buildings"" used by Hezbollah fighters in parts of southern Lebanon, according to the Israel Defense Forces.The areas include the Aita al-Shaab and the Taybeh in southern Lebanon, said Avichay Adraee, IDF spokesperson for Arab media, in a post on X.""During the day, several shells were fired from Lebanon towards the Upper Galilee region, without causing any casualties. IDF forces attacked the sources of fire,"" Adraee added. The Israeli airstrikes were before the 40 rockets that were launched from Lebanon toward northern Israel Friday evening and claimed by Hezbollah.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3:53 p.m. ET, April 12, 2024Biden expects an attack from Iran will happen ""sooner than later""From CNN's Samantha WaldenbergUS President Joe Biden gives remarks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus on Friday in Washington, DC.  Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden expects an attack from Iran will happen “sooner than later,""  he told reporters at the White House Friday. “I don’t want to get into secure information but my expectation is sooner than later,” Biden said when asked how imminent an attack on Israel was. Asked what his message to Tehran is right now, the president said “Don’t.”In response to more shouted questions from reporters asking if American troops were at risk, Biden returned to the podium and said that the United States is ""devoted” to the defense of Israel. “We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed,” Biden said. Remember: The United States says it is on high alert for a significant Iranian retaliatory attack following Israel's deadly strike on Tehran's consulate in Damascus last week, raising fears of a wider regional war. There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said earlier Friday, following Israel’s attack on a diplomatic compound in Syria that killed three Iranian generals.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

Exclusive: First-hand look at Israel's other war

Kafr Kila, Lebanon
CNN
         — 
    


            Shredded Lebanese and Hezbollah flags tower over a destroyed boardwalk where a panoramic view of Israel’s Upper Galilee stretches out for miles.
    

            “Buses (of people) used to come here just to see the Holy Land,” says Lt. Col. Juan Garcia Martinez, part of Spain’s peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon.
    

            CNN was embedded on Friday with a Spanish battalion on patrol of Lebanon’s southern border area, transformed by six months of crossfire between Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces.
    

            Craters pepper the roads and debris covers the sidewalks. Apart from a few Christian-majority villages that have largely been spared Israeli fire, the area is full of ghost towns — a mirror image of the northern-region of Israel where tens of thousands of residents have fled the fighting.

            More than 30,000 people have been displaced from the Lebanese area in the immediate perimeter of the 49-mile border, according to local authorities. Only one school remains functioning. More than 300 people — mostly fighters — have died in Israeli strikes. Eight civilians have been killed in Hezbollah attacks in northern Israel since last October. There have been Israeli soldier deaths in the cross-fire though the IDF has not provided an official tally.
    

            Minutes after the CNN team left the operations area of the UN mission in Lebanon (known as UNIFIL), Lebanon’s state news agency reported that machine guns were fired from Israel at a car belonging to local journalists. The Israeli military has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            A flare-up ensued, more intense than the usual daily exchange of fire, and more consequential due to a possible Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel expected as soon as this weekend.
    

            Hezbollah — the most powerful non-state actor in the region — coordinates closely with Iran. Mohammad Reza Zahidi, one of two high-ranking Iranian commanders killed in the April 1 airstrike on Tehran’s consulate in Damascus, was a key intermediary between Iran’s revolutionary guards and Hezbollah.
    

            Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths. That raised the specter of a conflict regional in scope and possibly catastrophic in its aftermath.

            Speculation swirled about whether Hezbollah would take part in Iran’s expected attack. But a Lebanese source familiar with the matter ruled this out. The attack will be “purely Iranian,” the source said.
    

            US intelligence appears to tally with this. The US has observed Iran moving military assets around inside its own country, including drones and cruise missiles, signaling a possible attack on Israeli targets from inside its territory, according to two people familiar with US intelligence.
    

            The US expects Iran to carry out direct strikes against targets inside Israel, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the intelligence.
    

            Hezbollah may only be compelled to join an Iranian war effort if the strike leads to further escalation, the same Lebanese source said. Hezbollah and other Iran-backed paramilitaries “will be prepared for the stage that comes after the Iranian response,” the source told CNN.
    

            On Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei appeared before a crowd wielding a rifle as he reiterated vows of revenge. Israel has been in a heightened state of alert since April 1. The widespread apprehension prompted officials there to urge people to refrain from stocking up on food, generators and medicine, as the country braces for the response.
    

            Still, US officials expect Iran’s attack to be calibrated to avoid a regional war. Meanwhile, Iran will seek to reassert itself as a regional force to be reckoned with, analysts say.
    

            “The broader objective for Iran seems to be one of de-escalation,” wrote Sina Toosi, a DC-based Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, in a post on X, “Tehran’s strategy aims to incrementally increase the repercussions for Israeli aggression, thereby deterring future incidents without escalating to an all-out war.”
    

            Iran has sought to walk that tightrope since it first entered the fray of the Iran-Hamas war in October. Its paramilitary partners — including Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis who have repeatedly struck a key Red Sea shipping route — link their battles to the war in Gaza.
    

            “We repeat, if it ends in Gaza, then it ends here,” Nasrallah said in a speech last week.
    

            Yet the conflict in Lebanon increases in complexity the longer Israel’s offensive in Gaza goes on.
    






Kafr Kila is a town that is - for the most part - deserted, and one that has borne the brunt of Israeli airstrikes in a series of back and forth exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah.

            When warnings about a possible Iranian attack reached fever pitch on Friday night, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets at Israel’s Upper Galilee, producing slew of intercepts from Israel’s anti-missile Iron Dome system.
    

            It provided a glimpse of how Hezbollah might attempt to overwhelm Israel’s defensive systems as Iran conducts its expected attack.
    

            The flighting on the Lebanon-Israel border has also re-opened long festering issues over the frontier, known as the blue line.
    

            Over the last six months, negotiations over the armistice line between Lebanon and Israel – imposed by the United Nations in 2000 after Hezbollah forced out a 22-year Israeli occupation – have been revived. Meanwhile, Western leaders have mounted pressure on Lebanon’s government to pull Hezbollah from the border area.

            Hezbollah’s supporters say this is far-fetched, and, at best,  unenforceable. But this diplomatic can of worms could protract the conflict in Lebanon.
    

            From one of Spain’s bases near the demarcation line, there is a clear view of a microcosm of Lebanon’s long-standing border issues with Israel.
    

            A verdant green field sowed with mines separates the base from the town of al-Ghajar. The blue line can be seen cutting through the town and splitting it in two. During the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006, Israel occupied the rest of the village — a UN watchtower marks the tip of the Israeli-occupied territory.
    

            “We are soldiers. We have to constantly adapt to the changing situation,” said Captain Hector Alonso from a viewing point overseeing Ghajar. Asked if Alonso’s unit was prepared for the growing danger of the present moment, he said: “We are prepared.”

         — 
    


            Hundreds of Israeli settlers surrounded Palestinian villages and attacked residents across the occupied West Bank, eyewitnesses told CNN, after an Israeli boy who had gone missing from a settlement was found dead.
    

            The body of Binyamin Achimair, 14, was found in the area of Malachei Ha’Shalom, with the Israeli military saying he was killed in a “terrorist attack.”
    

            It is unclear yet what was the cause of death, and the IDF is yet to provide evidence that this was a “terrorist attack.” CNN has reached out for clarity.
    

            Soon after, videos obtained by CNN show settlers setting houses and cars ablaze in the village of Duma, southeast of Nablus. Footage shows heavy smoke engulfing the air, as settlers fire gunshots in the area. Eyewitnesses said settlers stormed people’s houses, resulting in clashes with Palestinians.
    

            In one video obtained by CNN from Duma, one man described the situation as a “street war.”
    

            Videos on social media show clashes between Palestinians and settlers in the villages of Deir Dibwan and Beitin, east of Ramallah. Palestinians are seen lobbing rocks at the settlers, and Israeli military vehicles firing tear gas to disperse the crowds.
    

            The latest attacks by settlers come a day after a large-scale attack in the village of Al-Mughayyir east of Ramallah, leaving one Palestinian man dead, amid the search for Achimair. About 25 others were also injured in the rampage, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that authorities were searching for whoever killed Achimair, urging Israelis to not obstruct them.
    

            “The abominable murder of the boy Binyamin Achimair, may God avenge his blood, is a serious crime. I send my heartfelt condolences to his family,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s office (PMO) said in a statement.
    

            “IDF and Shin Bet forces are in an extensive pursuit of the despicable murderers and all those who cooperated with them,” it continued.

            The prime minister said Israeli security forces carry out “intense operational and intelligence activity” in the area and in Palestinian villages, urging the citizens of Israel to allow them to “do their work unhindered”.
    

            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday urged the public to avoid taking the law into their own hands.
    

            “I appeal to the public, let the security forces act quickly in the hunt for the terrorists - revenge actions will make it difficult for our fighters in their mission - the law must not be taken into one’s hands,” Gallant said in a post on X.
    

            Videos obtained by CNN show increased Israeli military presence at a checkpoint near the town of Sinjil, northeast of Ramallah.
    

            The Palestinian Red Crescent said in a statement Saturday that over a dozen Palestinians arrived at hospitals across the West Bank, most wounded by gunfire.
    

            Violence has been rising in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since the October 7 attacks. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah says at least 462 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or in settler attacks.

      Iranian navy seizes Israel-linked container ship amid escalating tensions in Middle East

         — 
    


            Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seized an Israeli-linked container ship in a helicopter operation near the Strait of Hormuz, state news agency IRNA reported, with tensions already high after Iran warned it would retaliate for a suspected Israeli strike on its consulate in Syria.
    

            IRNA reported that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy seized the Portuguese-flagged MSC Aries, which is now being “directed back to Iranian territorial waters.”
    

            According to IRNA, the vessel is managed by the Zodiac Maritime, a company linked to Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer.
    

            Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) has confirmed the seizure, saying there are 25 crew on board. Portugal’s government said that it was in touch with the Iranian authorities.
    

            The Strait of Hormuz, at the northern end of the Gulf of Oman, is the biggest oil chokepoint in the world. About 20% of the world’s daily consumption of oil passes through it every day.
    

            Iran has carried out similar seizures before. In January, Tehran seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman and transferred it to an Iranian port in response to the United States confiscating the same vessel and its oil last year.
    

            Tensions in the region are heightened after the strike on Iran’s consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus, which killed seven officials including a top IRGC commander, and the seizure comes against the backdrop of the conflict in Gaza.
    

            The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have frequently been targeting shipping in the Red Sea area, while there have been regular exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel along Lebanon’s southern border.
    

            The United States currently expects Iran will carry out strikes against multiple targets inside Israel and that Iranian proxies could also be involved in carrying out the attacks, sources say, in what would mark a major escalation.
    

            US President Joe Biden on Friday predicted that Iran’s attacks were coming “sooner rather than later” and sought to once again issue a stern public warning, saying that his message to Tehran was simply: “Don’t.”
    

            In a video statement released Saturday, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari warned Israel was on “high alert” for “Iranian aggression.”
    

            European officials warned against further escalation between Israel and Iran.
    

            The United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, wrote on social media platform X that he had spoken with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz.
    

            The two discussed their “shared concerns about Iranian threats to attack Israel,” Cameron wrote, adding that “further escalation in the region is in no-one’s interest and risks further loss of civilian life.”

Powell, Sophie Tanno, Emma Tucker, Kaanita Iyer, Paul LeBlanc and Adrienne Vogt, Jerome Taylor and James Legge, CNNUpdated 12:36 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024What we coveredThe Middle East has been plunged deeper into uncharted waters after Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones from its territory toward Israel in an unprecedented five-hour strike.The vast majority of missiles were intercepted outside Israel's territory by aerial defense systems, its military said. There have been no reports of injuries suffered directly through Iranian strikes, according to Israel’s emergency service. Iran's foreign ministry said the attack was in retaliation to a deadly Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month.President Joe Biden made clear US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, according to a senior administration official. But he said Washington's commitment to Israel’s security against Iranian threats remains ""ironclad."" US forces intercepted more than 70 drones and at least three ballistic missiles, according to US officials. The US assessment is that Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful.Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link104 PostsSort byLatestOldestDropdown arrow12:36 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024Our live coverage of Iran's attack on Israel has moved here.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:31 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024Iran warns its response will be ""stronger and more resolute"" if Israel retaliates following latest strikesFrom CNN’s Alireza Hajihosseini and Eyad KourdiAn anti-missile system operates as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, on Sunday. Amir Cohen/ReutersIran has warned that it will respond with more force if Israel retaliates over this weekend's strikes, which Tehran said were themselves a reply to an Israeli attack earlier this month on its embassy complex in Syria's capital Damascus.“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent right of self-defense when required,"" Iran’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a statement. Should the Israeli regime commit any military aggression again, Iran's response will assuredly and decisively be stronger and more resolute,” Ambassador Iravani added.Citing self-defense against repeated Israeli military aggressions, Iravani said the strikes were specifically in retaliation to an Israeli attack on April 1 against what Iran says were diplomatic facilities in Damascus. Iran claims the attack violated international law and led to the death of seven Iranian military advisors, including key commanders from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The statement also criticizes the United Nations Security Council for “failing to uphold international peace,” allowing Israel to “breach” established international norms and “escalate” regional tensions.Additional context: Israel has carried out numerous strikes on Iran-backed targets in Syria, often targeting weapons shipments allegedly intended for Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian proxy in Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the April 1 attack which destroyed an Iranian consulate building in the capital Damascus, including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top Revolutionary Guards commander.However an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN that their intelligence showed the building was not a consulate and was instead “a military building of Quds forces disguised as a civilian building.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link12:08 a.m. ET, April 14, 2024China expresses 'deep concern', calls for ceasefireFrom CNN's Philip Wang and Irene NasserChina has expressed ""deep concern"" over the ""current escalation"" following Iran's attack on Israel, according to a spokesperson for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, adding that it is a ""spillover of the Gaza conflict"" and a ceasefire should be implemented without delay.In a statement, China called ""on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalations.""""The ongoing situation is the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict,"" the spokesperson said, adding that a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas should be implemented without any more delay.Beijing did not name or condemn Hamas in the wake of the initial October 7 attacks. Since then, it has condemned the war and been a vocal proponent of an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of a “two-state” solution.Last month, Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian met Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar, the first meeting between a Chinese and Hamas official publicly acknowledged by Beijing since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.Wang’s visit follows efforts by Beijing to step up its profile as a peace broker in the Middle East conflict.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:45 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024US forces intercepted 70+ drones and at least three ballistic missiles, US officials sayFrom CNN's Oren Liebermann and Haley BritzkyUS forces intercepted more than 70 one-way attack drones and at least three ballistic missiles during Iran's attack on Israel, according to two US officials familiar with the situation.The ballistic missiles were intercepted by warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the officials said. Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles in total at Israel, according to a senior administration official. The US Navy currently has two destroyers in that area, both are guided missile destroyers capable of intercepting missile and drone launches.US fighter jets were also part of the response to Iran’s attack on Saturday and shot down drones launched towards Israel, another US official told CNN.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:40 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Biden to meet with G7 leaders Sunday as he condemns Iran's ""brazen attack"" From CNN’s Lauren KoenigUS President Joe Biden will meet with G7 leaders Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” according to a statement released by the White House. “My team will engage with their counterparts across the region. And we will stay in close touch with Israel’s leaders,” the statement from Biden reads. “And while we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today, we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people.”US defensive assets moved to the region earlier this week and “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” according to the statement.Biden also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu following Saturday’s attack “to reaffirm America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.” I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks – sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” the president wrote.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:37 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024United Airlines cancels three Middle East flightsFrom CNN’s Sara SmartAt least three United Airlines flights headed to or departing from the Middle East have been canceled amid the ongoing conflict unfolding between Iran and Israel.On Saturday a flight from Newark, New Jersey to Tel Aviv, a flight from Washington D.C. to Amman, Jordan, and one from Dubai to Newark were canceled, the airline told CNN in a statement.We are closely monitoring the situation and will make decisions on upcoming flights with a focus on the safety of our customers and crews,” the airline said.There have been no changes to any Sunday flights for United as of Saturday night, according to the airline. CNN has reached out to other airlines regarding cancellations.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:22 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Biden told Netanyahu US will not participate in offensive operations against Iran, US official saysFrom CNN's MJ LeeA US Marine guards the entrance to the West Wing of the White House on Saturday.

No cruise missile made impact, the official said, and nothing of “value” was hit. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:21 p.m. ET, April 13, 2024Bolton: 'Passivity at this point for Israel would be a big mistake'From CNN's Heather ChenJohn Bolton, the former US national security adviser and ambassador to the UN, said “passivity at this point for Israel would be a big mistake,” warning of more attacks. “This is not time to play academic games and message and signal. This is a question of power,” Bolton told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. ""If they came from a different location containing nuclear warheads, Israel might not be so lucky.”A known Iran policy hawk, Bolton served in senior national security positions during the Trump and Bush administrations. A neoconservative, Bolton has in the past advocated war with Iran and a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. In 2022, he was the target of an alleged assassination attempt orchestrated by a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He has warned against underestimating Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran has said is for peaceful purposes only.“I think we have enough experience with faulty intelligence by now, not to be so sure, not to know how much of Iran’s uranium enrichment program is really being conducted under a mountain in North Korea,” Bolton said.If Tehran sent “a wire transfer to Pyongyang,” it would give the North Koreans “enough time to put a couple of warheads on an airplane and fly them to Tehran. (But) if you take away their nuclear capability, that would be a dramatic hit to the regime, maybe enough to topple it.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.

Retired general breaks down Israeli defense system

CNN
         — 
    


            Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel on Saturday night, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria, bringing the long-running shadow war between the two sides into the open and raising the prospect of full-blown regional conflict.
    

            More than 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israel in an immense aerial attack overnight, but “99%” of them were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its “partners,” according to the Israeli military.
    

            The reprisals marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil, marking a dangerous new inflection point in the fast widening Middle East conflict. 


            Iran has warned that it will respond with “stronger and more resolute” actions if Israel retaliates over this weekend’s strikes, according to Tehran’s ambassador to the United Nations.
    

            In a phone call with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, US President Joe Biden made clear the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran – as he reaffirmed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel,” a senior White House official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            The US assessed that almost all of the drones and missiles – including more than 100 ballistic missiles – launched by Iran had been knocked out of the sky. No cruise missile made impact and nothing of “value” was hit, according to the administration official.
    

            There have been no reports of injuries suffered directly through Iranian strikes, according to Israel’s emergency service, though it said a 7-year-old girl had been severely injured by shrapnel from Israel’s interceptor missile.
    

            As news of the attack broke, public shelters were opened in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and large public gatherings banned. Israel closed its airspace, as did nearby Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon. By Sunday morning both Israel and Jordan reopened their airspace.
    

            CNN’s team in Jerusalem could hear explosions and sirens as apparent intercepts took place early Sunday morning local time.
    

            “We are continuing to see multiple intercepts in the skies above me coming from multiple different directions. It’s hard to tell what is an incoming missile and what is an intercept,” CNN’s Nic Robertson reported.
    

            “I’m hearing multiple, multiple detonations, again of what sound like interceptions. I am not hearing the sound of impacts,” he said, adding that his team had already witnessed dozens of apparent intercepts.
    

            By early morning Sunday local time, Iran’s mission to the United Nations announced that the attack was now “deemed concluded” – but warned of potential future escalation.
    

            Separately, more than 55 rockets were fired from Lebanon to Israel on early morning Sunday local time, according to the Israeli military.

            The onslaught against Israel prompted Biden to hold a lengthy meeting with his national security team on Saturday night to assess the situation, according to a US official.
    

            Biden will also meet with G7 leaders on Sunday “to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran’s brazen attack,” according to a statement released by the White House.
    

            US defensive assets moved to the region earlier this week and “helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” according to the statement.
    

            US forces intercepted more than 70 one-way attack drones and at least 3 ballistic missiles Iran fired toward Israel, according to two US official familiar with the situation.
    

            The ballistic missiles were intercepted by warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the officials said. The US Navy currently has two destroyers in that area, both are guided missile destroyers capable of intercepting missile and drone launches.
    

            US fighter jets were also part of the US’ response to Iran’s attack on Saturday and shot down drones launched towards Israel, another US official told CNN.

    Retaliation for strike on embassy complex


            Fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could spiral into a wider regional conflict have been been rising since Iran accused Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.
    

            Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would be punished for the attack, while President Ebrahim Raisi said it would “not go unanswered,” state news agency IRNA reported. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said the strike would be met with “punishment and revenge.”
    




            Israel has not publicly acknowledged responsibility for the strike but said it believed the building struck was a “military building of Quds forces” — a unit of the IRGC responsible for foreign operations.
    

            Shortly after the launch of the drones on Saturday night, Iran’s Defense Minister, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, warned that any country that allows Israel to use its airspace or territory for attacking Iran would face a “decisive response.”
    

    How the world reacted


            In a statement released on Telegram, Iran’s Foreign Ministry claimed the attack showed Iran’s “responsible approach to regional and international peace and security at a time [of] illegal and genocidal actions by the Zionist apartheid regime against the Palestinian people.”
    

            However, a host of countries from the Middle East to Europe and Latin America voiced concerns over the possibility for escalation, many of them condemning Iran’s actions.
    

            UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying he was “deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation.” Regional powers Saudi Arabia and Egypt voiced similar concerns, with Egypt saying it was in contact with “all concerned parties to try to contain the situation.”
    

            Various European countries condemned the attack and expressed support for Israel, with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, describing it on X as “an unprecedented escalation and a grave threat to regional security.”
    

            The UK and France both reiterated their commitments to Israel’s security, with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak saying Iran had “once again demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard.”
    

            The Netherlands, Austria and the Czech Republic also condemned the attack and expressed support for Israel, while Spain and Portugal called for de-escalation.
    

            China has also expressed “deep concern” over the escalation, calling on “relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalations.” It called the attack a “spillover of the Gaza conflict” and urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            Over the past months, American officials have urged Beijing to use its leverage over Iran to help prevent a regionwide conflict. China has been Iran’s biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran’s oil exports.


            In Latin America, Chile and Mexico both condemned the use of force, while Argentina’s President Javier Milei cut short a trip to Denmark to fly back to his country and form a crisis committee. His spokesperson Manuel Adorni said the meeting was to “take charge of the situation and coordinate actions with the presidents of the Western world.”

      As Iran attacks Israel, Biden confronts an escalating Middle East crisis he had hoped to avoid

         — 
    


            For President Joe Biden, an attack on Israel launched from Iranian soil amounts to a scenario he’d greatly sought to avoid since the start of the current Middle East conflict.
    

            The reprisals heighten the risk of a wider regional conflict that could directly draw in the United States, along with other countries.
    

            And they place Biden — again — in the tenuous position of pledging stalwart support for Israel while also trying to prevent a new conflagration from exploding with the United States involved.
    

            What comes next is unknown. In the immediate aftermath of Iran’s attacks, American officials acknowledged they were entering uncharted territory.  One significant question mark is how proxies might potentially join Iranian efforts to target Israel and add a new layer of unpredictability. And with Israel’s plans for a response still being formed, Biden administration officials are expected to continue advising their Israeli counterparts – with the desire for containment in mind.
    

            In a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday night, in which Biden told Netanyahu to consider Saturday a win because the US assessed Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, Biden made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran in response, a senior administration official told CNN.
    

            But in the hours following Iran’s attack, it became clear the president faces a severe challenge putting a lid on the flare-up between Iran and Israel and stopping a full-scale regional war breaking out.
    

            Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, but the scope of that response has yet to be determined, an Israeli official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on Sunday.
    

            The official said Israel is yet to determine whether to try to “break all the dishes” or do something more measured.
    

            Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting on Sunday.
    

            The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Hossein Salami warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates saying a “new equation” had been created.
    

            Biden is also operating within the fraught politics of an election year, lending outsized importance to his upcoming decisions. The eruption of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 has hurt Biden at home, eroding his support with key constituencies as he has declined to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            One of the reasons Biden returned urgently to the White House from his beach house in Delaware Saturday afternoon was the ongoing nature of the attack, one official said, with the Situation Room better equipped for real-time monitoring of events.
    

            Administration officials saw Iran’s attacks on Israel Saturday as disproportionate to Israel’s strikes in Damascus that prompted the retaliation, a US official told CNN.
    

            That view has been an important factor in the discussions taking place in the White House throughout the day on next steps, particularly as Biden is set on preventing a full-scale regional conflict from erupting.
    

            There is also a recognition that what Israel is likely to do in response will depend on a full damage assessment, including potential casualties, so the Biden administration’s advice to Israel will depend on that picture coming into focus, the official added.
    

            In the immediate aftermath of the Israeli strikes in Syria that killed top Iranian commanders, US officials monitored Iran gearing up to launch a major attack on Israel, seeing it as inevitable. As the US, in close consultation with Israel, sought to figure out exactly how, when and where exactly Iran would retaliate, administration officials never fully ruled out Iran trying to strike inside Israel as well as American personnel and assets in the region.
    

            The most likely “worst case scenario,” one senior administration official said in the days leading up to Iran’s Saturday attacks, was a direct attack by Iran on Israel, and the eruption of a state-on-state conflict that could very well prompt the beginning of a wider regional conflict that the US has been working to prevent since the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attacks.
    

            Despite his current tensions with Netanyahu over the war in Gaza, Biden and his top officials have sought over the past week to diminish any daylight between the US and Israel when it comes to Israel’s defense against Iran.
    

            In the hours before Iran launched its attack, the US defense secretary and national security adviser spoke with their counterparts in Israel to reiterate that support. And last week, Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, was in Israel discussing contingencies with officials ahead of the expected attack.
    

            Biden kept to his Friday promise that “the US is devoted to the defense of Israel,” with defense officials telling CNN that the US military successfully intercepted some Iranian missiles on Saturday.
    

            Contained within the conversations about preparations for Iran’s attack and coordinating a response were also implicit encouragement to the Israeli government to not allow the situation to spiral out of control if Iran’s response was limited in nature, officials familiar with the matter said.
    

            The US also sent messages publicly and privately to Iran warning about escalating the crisis further and pressed European and Arab allies to use their own leverage with Tehran to deliver similar messages.
    

            As Iran’s plans to attack Israel grew clearer, American officials increasingly assessed that Tehran was not seeking direct conflict with the United States. Ahead of the drone attack launched by Iran on Saturday, US officials said they did not expect the targets to include American forces in the region.
    

            That is a change from earlier in the conflict, when Iran-backed militias regularly attacked US troops in the Middle East, including in a strike that killed three Americans stationed in Jordan. After the US launched retaliatory strikes, the attacks by Iranian proxies waned.
    

            Yet the simmering tensions between Iran and Israel have not let up. Without any direct channels of communication between the two countries, the risk of miscalculation is amplified.

         — 
    


            Almost all the ballistic missiles and drones Iran launched at Israel in an unprecedented attack late Saturday were intercepted and failed to meet their mark, according to Israeli and American officials, highlighting the formidable, and multi-layered missile defense deployed by the two allied partners.
    

            Most of the more than 300 Iranian munitions, the majority of which are believed to have been launched from inside of Iran’s territory during a five-hour attack, were intercepted before they got to Israel, more than 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from their launch points.
    

            Israel’s military said Sunday that “99%” of projectiles fired by Iran were intercepted by Israel and its partners, with only “a small number” of ballistic missiles reaching Israel.
    

            In total, around 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles were launched at Israel by Iran overnight Saturday, the military said.
    

            In a call Sunday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that constituted a win for Israel as nothing of “value” was hit, a senior US administration official told CNN.
    

            US officials said more than 70 drones and three ballistic missiles were intercepted by US Navy ships and military aircraft, without giving details of exactly what defenses were used to bring down the projectiles.

'Massive failure of Israeli and American deterrence': John Bolton on Iranian strikes

            The US Navy shot down at least three ballistic missiles using the Aegis missile defense system aboard two guided-missiles destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, officials told CNN’s Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon.
    

            US warplanes also shot down Iranian ordnance, Liebermann reported. While it was not revealed from where those US jets operated, there are US Navy aircraft carriers and land-based aircraft well within range of the region.
    

            Biden said in a statement the US was well-prepared to help defend Israel against the Iranian attack.
    

            “To support the defense of Israel, the US military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week,” the US president said in a statement.
    

            “Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles,” Biden said.
    

            Britain said it was also prepared to intervene using Royal Air Force aircraft it has in the region.
    

            “These UK jets will intercept any airborne attacks within range of our existing missions, as required,” a Defense Ministry statement said.
    

            An Israeli military spokesperson also said France was involved in blocking the Iranian attacks.
    

            “We are working closely with the US, UK and France who acted tonight. This partnership has always been close, but tonight it manifested itself in an unusual way,” the spokesperson said.

Retired general predicts more attacks following drone strikes launched by Iran

            Meanwhile, Israel operates a range of systems to block attacks from everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.
    

            Israel’s Iron Dome system has been in the headlines often since the country began its military offensive in Gaza in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks inside Israel that sparked the current hostilities in the region.
    

            The Iron Dome is the bottom layer of Israel’s missile defense, according to the country’s Missile Defense Organization (IMDO).
    

            There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries in Israel, each equipped with a radar that detects rockets and then uses a command-and-control system that quickly calculates whether an incoming projectile poses a threat or is likely to hit an unpopulated area. If the rocket does pose a threat, the Iron Dome fires missiles from the ground to destroy it in the air.

            The next rung up the missile defense ladder is David’s Sling, which protects against short- and medium-range threats, according to the IMDO.
    

            David’s Sling, a joint project of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense System and US defense giant Raytheon, uses Stunner and SkyCeptor kinetic hit-to-kill interceptors to take out targets as far as 186 miles away, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS).
    

            Above David’s Sling are Israel’s Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, jointly developed with the United States.
    

            The Arrow 2 uses fragmentation warheads to destroy incoming ballistic missiles in their terminal phase – as they dive toward their targets – in the upper atmosphere, according to the CSIS. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the Arrow 2 an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.
    

            Meanwhile, the Arrow 3 uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.
    

            Israel also has state-of-the-art fighter aircraft, including F-35I stealth jets that it has used to shoot down drones and cruise missiles before, according to news reports.
    

            The ballistic missiles that did reach Israel fell on the Netavim Air Base in southern Israel, Israel’s military spokesman said, adding that they caused only light structural damage. The base was functioning and continuing its operations following the attack, with planes continuing to use the base, he added.
    

            Photos released by the Israeli Air Force early Sunday showed F-35 and F-15 fighter jets returning to their bases in Israel after what were called successful “interceptions” and “aerial defense missions.”
    

            Some of the weapons launched at Israel were fired from Iraq and Yemen, the spokesman added.

      Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

Beirut, Lebanon
CNN
         — 
    


            A decades-long shadow war burst out into the open overnight as Iranian drones and missiles lit up the night sky in Israel and the occupied West Bank. Tehran’s operation was highly choreographed, apparently designed to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle.
    

            This was a complex mission. Over 300 drones and missiles navigated above Iran’s neighbors, including Jordan and Iraq — both with US military bases — before penetrating the airspace of Iran’s mortal enemy, Israel. Israel’s allies helped shoot down the bulk of these weapons, but couldn’t prevent what was long believed to be the Middle East’s doomsday scenario, the Islamic Republic’s first-ever attack on Israel.
    

            Israel’s fabled Iron Dome air defense system did not disappoint Israelis, many of whom took to bunkers. Only a small handful of locations were attacked, including a military base and an area in the Negev desert, injuring a Bedouin child, while the dome fended off one of the largest drone attacks in history
    

            Yet it was an operation that seemed designed to fail — when Iran launched its killer drones from its own territory some 1,000 miles away, it was giving Israel hours of advance notice.
    

            The symbolism of the attack did the heavy lifting. Rather than fire from one of the neighboring countries where Iran and its non-state allies are present, this was a direct attack from Iranian territory on Israeli territory. This compromised Iran’s ability to damage Israel because it robbed the operation of the element of surprise.
    

            Yet for some four hours, the world held its breath as weapons whizzed through the night sky. They were balls of fire hovering overhead as onlookers across three different countries filmed images that seemed to harken the start of a cataclysmic war.

            The lead time meant that Israel and its regional partners could ready Israel’s defenses, and the operation amounted to little more than a terrifying fireworks display. When Iran’s permanent mission at the United Nations tweeted that the operation had “concluded,” it was easy to come away from it thinking the Islamic Republic was all bark and no bite.
    

            The strike served as a retaliation against the Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s consulate in Damascus earlier in April that killed a top commander, and it was in keeping with US intelligence and analysts’ expectations. Iran’s leadership felt compelled to strike Israel in order to reiterate its position as a regional powerhouse and to dispel notions of it as a paper tiger. It doubled down on its show of force by launching the operation from its own territory and not by proxy in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq.
    

            Yet Iran also needed to try to avoid sparking an all-out war. Its economy has buckled under the weight of Trump-era sanctions, and there is growing discontent on its streets over the government’s repressive policies. On Sunday, Iran appeared not only to have factored in Israel’s robust air defense systems, but to have relied on it. The relatively high degree of US intelligence about the operation also suggests Iran may have engaged in back-channelling with Western leaders. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said he gave neighboring countries, including major US allies, 72-hour notice. To contain the fall-out of their own operation, they appeared intent to foil it.
    

            The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.
    

            At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.
    

            Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.

            In a future Iran strike, Tehran may not hesitate to use Israel’s northern border as a launching pad. A week before the attack, one Lebanese source familiar with the matter had ruled out that Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful armed group partner, would be part of Iran’s initial retaliation to the April 1 consulate strike.
    

            However, the source warned that Hezbollah and other Iran-backed fighting forces “will be prepared for the stage that comes after the Iranian response.”
    

            A forceful Israeli retaliation may push Iran to take on an even more hardline position beyond its Israel policy. Conservatives have consolidated control of Iran’s government in recent years, and there is growing resistance to Western pressure to curb the country’s feared uranium enrichment program.
    

            “There must be some satisfaction in certain circles in DC and Israel that Iran’s limited response reflects the imbalance of power in Israel’s favor,” wrote Trita Parsi, DC-based Iran analyst and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute, on X.
    

            “But think further and you’ll realise how this episode will strengthen those in Tehran who believe Iran must go nuclear.”

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

CNN
         — 
    


            President Joe Biden and senior members of his national security team, seeking to contain the risk of a wider regional war following a barrage of Iranian missiles and drones directed toward Israel, have told their counterparts the US will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, according to US officials familiar with the matter.
    

            In a conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday, Biden sought to frame Israel’s successful interception of the Iranian onslaught as a major victory — with the suggestion that further Israeli response was unnecessary.
    

            Biden told the Israeli prime minister in his phone call that he should consider Saturday a win because Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful and demonstrated Israel’s superior military capability, a senior administration official said. The US assessed that there was “no significant damage within Israel itself,” according to a senior US military official.
    

            John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said Sunday the ability to prevent widespread damage was a demonstration of Israel’s “military superiority” and proof that Iran was not the “military power that they claim to be.”

Kirby: Israel’s response to Iran’s attack ‘was an incredible success’




            “This was an incredible success, really proving Israel’s military superiority and just as critically, their diplomatic superiority, that they have friends in the region, that they have around the world that are willing to help them,” Kirby told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    

            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asked his Israeli counterpart, Minister Yoav Gallant, to notify the US ahead of any potential response to the Iranian attack, according to another US official.
    

            Even as American officials stressed to their counterparts that the final decision on how to respond to Iran is up to Israel, Biden has sought to prevent a wider escalation of the conflict.
    

            On Sunday, Biden met with his fellow Group of Seven leaders to discuss a “united diplomatic response” — with the emphasis on non-military actions that would limit the prospects of a wider war.
    

            In a joint statement released after the virtual meeting, the G7 members condemned “in the strongest terms” Iran’s “direct and unprecedented attack” against Israel and expressed their “full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our commitment towards its security.”
    

            “With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 statement said.
    

            A senior administration official later described the convening of leaders and their discussion about Iran as “constructive” and stressed ongoing support for Israel.
    

            “We are committed to defending Israel. We would not be a part of any of any response they do. That’s very consistent policy,” the senior administration official said.

Israeli Prime Minister's Office



            Whether Netanyahu takes Biden’s advice remains an open question. The Iranian reprisals came at a moment of deep tension between the men over the war in Gaza. Throughout that conflict, the limits of American influence on Israeli decision-making have been laid bare.
    

            Israel told the United States that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” the senior Biden administration said Sunday.
    

            “The president was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel, and he made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” the senior administration official said.
    

            Iran’s decision to fire weapons from its own territory toward Israel significantly ratchets up the long-simmering enmity between the two countries. There will likely be political pressure from inside Israel for some type of response.
    

            Kirby said the attack — the first launched from Iranian soil against Israel — did not necessarily have to constitute the start of a broader regional war.
    

            “We don’t believe it is nor do we believe it has to be,” he told Tapper, noting that the US and Israel both had a good sense of what Iran was planning to do ahead of time.
    

            Gallant warned Sunday that the confrontation with Iran is “not over yet.” The country’s response options are expected to be discussed in detail during a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet meeting.
    

            The Commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, warned that Tehran would respond directly if Israel retaliates, saying a “new equation” had been created.
    

    Tense moments in the Situation Room


            Biden gathered Saturday with his national security team for “real-time updates” on Iran’s attack against Israel – at times leading to “tense moments” in the White House Situation Room.
    

            One of those tense moments occurred when over 100 ballistic missiles were in the sky, with a short travel time to Israel.
    

            “The results of the defenses, of course, were unclear until all was said and done. As the results of the defenses came in, which is when we knew that preparations and planning had succeeded, there was a bit of a relief,” the senior administration official said.
    

            US officials have touted ongoing preparations ahead of Iran’s attack, which had been anticipated since a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

            Preparations ahead of Saturday’s attack started “nearly two weeks ago,” the senior administration official said, and involved a force posture adjustment, and ongoing discussions with Israelis and other partners in the region, among other measures.
    

            After the White House determined Saturday’s attack was largely defeated, Biden connected with Netanyahu.
    

            Biden has continued to be routinely updated, according to officials. On Sunday morning, the president again gathered his advisers in the Situation Room, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, and Mideast coordinator Brett McGurk.

            Thousands of Palestinians, including men, women, children and elderly, attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday when they came under Israeli fire.
    

            Video filmed by a CNN stringer shows the once-perilous coastal road of Al Rasheed filled with families walking with their belongings, some riding bicycles, donkey carts and pick-up trucks, smiling and snapping photographs.
    

            “I’m going to Gaza City. It’s enough. We need to go back to our homes and lands. We are tired of displacement… we heard people saying we can go back, but no one official told us. We’ll leave it to God,” Majd El-Aqqad said.

            Videos began circulating online Sunday morning showing people heading to the north for the first time in such large numbers. Some people told CNN they heard the Israeli military was allowing women and children to move back up. Others said their relatives were allowed to cross over.
    

            In response to a question from CNN, the IDF said the reports were false.
    

            “The northern Gaza Strip continues to be an active war zone and return to the area is not currently permitted,” IDF said.
    

            In the video shot for CNN, an elderly woman named Um Mohammad walks along the road carrying a heavy bag on her head and two others in her arms, attempting to reach her home.
    

            She cries and prays for God to protect them.
    

            “I don’t know anything about my house. It’s our home and our land. The Israelis displaced us and humiliated us,” she said.
    

            “We are tired here. We have been displaced for 191 days,” Malak Abu Nada, a woman from Jabalya, told CNN.
    






Majd El-Aqqad said she is returning to Gaza City. ""We need to go back to our homes and lands. We are tired of displacement,"" she said.

            Many of the people who attempted to head north had been displaced to Rafah, where Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been threatening to launch an offensive that the UN said would lead to a “humanitarian catastrophe.”
    

            The Gaza Ministry of Health reported on Sunday that the toll in the Gaza Strip since October 7 has risen to 33,729 dead and 76,371 people injured.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.
    

            A young boy named Omar Al-Dahdouh carried a bag of flour on his shoulder, holding his younger sibling’s hand and sobbing as he walked.
    

            “I am going home. I have been displaced for six months. We live in a tent because our house was struck,” he said.
    

            “I am not afraid. If I must die, I will die, but I don’t want to live this anymore. I want to go home, I’m tired. My siblings need to live,” he continued.
    

            Ahmad Ramadan told CNN he had tried to cross to the north but was turned back by Israeli soldiers because he was a man.
    

            “We heard the road was open to Gaza City, so we thought we’d go. When they saw men with us, they started shooting at us. We are tired and humiliated,” Um Awni Al-Jarousha told CNN.
    

            Footage shows people turning around, heading back south with the sound of drones and planes buzzing overhead. Missiles can be seen in the distance while people run in panic.
    

            “We reached all the way to the checkpoint until we saw Israeli tanks. We headed back because they fired towards us. We didn’t see anyone make it to the other side. We risked our children’s lives to cross, but apparently it was all a lie,” one woman said.

            Video shows several people with what appear to be gunshot wounds. One man is seen carrying another man who has blood streaming along his face from a head injury.
    

            Another man is seen carrying a 5-year-old girl named Sally Abu Laila, who is bleeding from her head and surrounded by people trying to help.
    

            Her mother Sabreen told CNN her daughter was in her arms when Israeli soldiers shot at her. They had attempted to cross into the north with Sabreen’s husband, but the soldiers turned him back, leaving her and her four children to face the journey alone.
    

            The moment she tried to pass through, two young men squeezed in between her and other women waiting in line at the checkpoint. That’s when Israeli soldiers fired at them, she said.
    

            Chaos then ensued, with Sabreen describing people trampling over each other as they tried to escape the gunshots.

            “I tried to put my daughter on the ground to walk, but she couldn’t move. I saw my hands covered in blood. I called on her, ‘Sally! Sally! Sally!’, but she didn’t answer… I didn’t know my daughter was injured… she is my only girl, and my heart broke,” Sabreen told CNN.
    

            Eventually, she said, she managed to get to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, where her daughter is undergoing treatment. She told CNN she is still in intensive care.
    

            Graphic footage shot for CNN shows Sally crying out in pain, blood on her body with a wound on her head and arm as she gets treated by two doctors.
    

            CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on reports that its soldiers fired shots at civilians trying to head up north, but has not received a response.

      Opinion: What does Iran really want?

CNN
         — 
    


            On the surface, Iran’s Saturday missile and drone attack on Israel was a response to the Israelis’ airstrike on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus two weeks ago that killed at least seven officials, including commanders of the nation’s Revolutionary Guards.
    

            Yet it also was an outgrowth of the enmity between Iran and Israel, including its ally the United States, that has been building for decades, a result of both the Iranian regime’s nature and of policy reversals and blunders by the US ever since the Western- and Israel-allied Shah of Iran was overthrown by Islamists in the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
    

            “A modern, strong, peaceful Iran could become a pillar of stability and progress in the region,” former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in 2006. “This cannot happen unless Iran’s leaders decide whether they are representing a cause or a nation – whether their basic motivation is crusading or international cooperation.”
    

            Like other regimes driven by a revolutionary ideology, Iran’s ayatollahs chose to be a cause, exporting their influence and ideas to other countries and to an array of militant groups.
    

            The goals of the ayatollahs are threefold: to evict the United States from the Middle East, to replace Israel with Palestine and to bring down the US-led world order, according to Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour, whom I recently interviewed for the Audible podcast “In the Room with Peter Bergen.” These are not modest goals, but Sadjadpour said you can’t underestimate the revolutionary fervor of Iran’s leaders.

Israel weighs response after Iran fires missile barrage




            The Iranian campaign to evict the United States from the Middle East began in Lebanon in the early 1980s, when Iran backed a ragtag bunch of militants living in the Shia-dominated areas of southern Beirut who had founded Hezbollah, “the party of God.”
    

            Using the then-novel technique of suicide bombings, they bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including eight CIA officers, the deadliest day in CIA history. Hezbollah also bombed the Marine barracks building in Beirut, killing 241 American service members.
    

            Those attacks by Hezbollah achieved their aim. The Reagan administration pulled all US forces out of Lebanon. A wealthy young Saudi fundamentalist named Osama bin Laden was watching closely: He concluded that if you applied enough military pressure on the Americans, they would pull out of the Middle East.
    

            After bin Laden’s al Qaeda attacked the US on September 11, 2001, the Americans effectively handed the Iranians a big gift, which was the 2003 overthrow of their mortal enemy, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, against whom Iran had fought a ruinous, almost-decade-long war during the 1980s.
    

Following the fall of Saddam, Iraq was wracked by a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands. Iran introduced into the Iraqi war zone highly effective roadside bombs known as EFPs – Explosively Formed Penetrators – that wounded and killed hundreds of American soldiers. In 2011, the US withdrew from Iraq.
    

            The official US Army history of the Iraq War concluded that Iran was the only winner of that war. This wasn’t the conclusion of vocal war critic Noam Chomsky but of a group of sober US Army historians.
    

    Iran’s ‘cookie-cutter approach’


            Norman Roule was the top US intelligence official on Iran from 2008 to 2017. Roule observed to me for the “In the Room” podcast that “Iran uses a cookie-cutter approach across the region, but the dough in each country is different, and the cooking time is different.”
    

            In Syria, a civil war began in 2011, and Iran saw another opportunity for this cookie-cutter approach by propping up the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad with billions of dollars of aid as well as Iranian advisers and Hezbollah forces on the ground fighting for the Assad regime.
    

            That explains the continued presence in Damascus today of senior Iranian military leaders and advisers like the ones who were killed by the Israeli airstrike on April 1 that precipitated Iran’s missile and drone barrage against Israel on Saturday.
    

            In Yemen, the Houthis started fighting the central government, and – particularly after Iran’s rival for regional dominance, the Saudis, intervened in the Yemeni war in 2015 – Iran trained the Houthis and supplied them with missiles and drones. These are the same weapons that the Houthis have been using against ships in the Red Sea, effectively closing the shipping route to and from the Suez Canal and cutting off a critical route for global trade.

            And then there is Hamas. While Iran had no foreknowledge of Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, according to Christine Abizaid, the director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, Iran has supplied Hamas with hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons and training, according to the US Treasury Department.
    

            Iran’s proxies in the Middle East, to one degree or another, now exert significant influence on Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. These proxies are grandiloquently known as “the axis of resistance” to Israel and the United States, and they exert their influence on a region that extends 1,500 miles from the north in Lebanon to Yemen’s Red Sea coast in the south. And now the Iranians are closer than ever to having nuclear weapons.
    

            The most significant foreign policy blunder of the Trump administration was pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal inked by the Obama administration, which was preventing the Iranians from enriching uranium above around 4%; you need around 90% enrichment of uranium for a nuclear device. Before former President Donald Trump reneged on the deal, Iran was observing the terms of the nuclear agreement, according to Trump’s own intelligence chiefs. Today, the Iranians reportedly have enough highly enriched uranium for three weapons and are considered closer than ever to having a workable nuclear weapon.
    

    ‘Deemed concluded’?


            Saturday’s drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can’t be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, according to the Israeli military. It’s likely that Iran’s theocratic regime, which has faced major internal protests and is approaching a generational transition, wanted to respond to calls for retribution for the Damascus attack without triggering a major war with two superior militaries – that of the US and Israel.
    

            The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York released a statement as Iran’s attacks were in progress, saying they had now responded to the strike against “our diplomatic premises in Damascus” and “the matter can be deemed concluded.”
    









President Joe Biden speaks to the National Action Network Convention remotely from the South Court Auditorium of the White House, Friday, April 12, 2024, in Washington. President Biden's re-election campaign is wrangling with the Republican-dominated states of Ohio and Alabama to assure he's listed on their November ballots, amid hints that a routine procedural negotiation is becoming politically charged.

Biden tells Netanyahu US will not participate in any counter-strike against Iran




            That, of course, doesn’t mean that Israel will deem the matter concluded. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hasn’t achieved his strategic objectives in Gaza of wiping out Hamas militarily and returning the 100 or so hostages held by Hamas, and is also not well-liked by most Israelis, can surely benefit from a rally-around-the-flag effect by casting himself as an assertive wartime leader. Of course, the Israeli public may also demand action to restore deterrence against Iran, having just lived through a barrage of Iranian missile and drone strikes.
    

            So, despite President Joe Biden calling Netanyahu on Saturday night to tell him that Iran’s attack hadn’t succeeded and saying the US wouldn’t support any counterattack, it would hardly be in character for Netanyahu not to respond in some fashion against Iran.
    

            And here is where things might get even worse as the burgeoning regional conflict that the Biden administration has long tried to avoid is now in higher gear, and it’s unclear where everyone’s red lines are and what might trigger a major war with Iran.
    

            As Abizaid noted in an interview for my podcast before Saturday’s attack by Iran, the issue is that “everyone has sort of a loose understanding of what these red lines might be, and events could change your perception of whether one of those has been crossed at any given time.”
    

    The Iraq factor


            On Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani will meet with Biden at the White House. The meeting comes at a time when there is considerable pressure in Iraq to withdraw the 2,500 US troops who remain there on an anti-ISIS mission.
    

            The withdrawal of the US troops from neighboring Iraq is a key goal of Iran, which exerts considerable influence over some Iraqi politicians.

            This poses a dilemma for both the Iraqi government and the Biden administration since the US troops based in Iraq have been frequent targets of Iranian-backed militias since the Gaza war started. While these attacks stopped following the killing of three US soldiers by an Iranian-backed militia in Jordan in January, if conflict were to start heating up with Iran, those attacks against US bases in Iraq could resume.
    

            Balanced against that is that the last time the US pulled all its forces out of Iraq was in 2011, and within three years, ISIS had taken over much of the country, a history that the vast majority of Iraqis do not want to repeat.
    

            It will be interesting to see whether, given the increasingly bellicose stance of the Iranians, the Biden administration puts considerable pressure on the Iraqi prime minister to keep those US soldiers on the ground in Iraq.

         — 
    


            Congressional leaders from both parties were quick to condemn Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel this Saturday but still remain at odds on how to pass additional Israel funding in wake of the attacks.
    

            House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he will move forward with a vote on additional Israel aid but did not go into specifics about his plans as he walks a knife’s edge with conservatives over the potential inclusion of Ukraine funding.
    

            “The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We’re going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We’re looking at the options and all these supplemental issues,” Johnson told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    

            But hardline conservatives are warning Johnson against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package, underscoring the competing pressures on the speaker as he weighs critical decisions about the path ahead following Iran’s attack on Israel.
    

            “Congress should be clear: no action by Iran or Israel merits a vote on the Ukraine omnibus the Senate seeks,” GOP Rep. Warren Davidson wrote on social media.
    

            The pressure campaign from Johnson’s right flank comes amid bipartisan calls — including from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell — to take up the Senate-passed foreign package that includes money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, arguing that is the fastest way to get aid to Israel.
    

            Johnson has vowed to put some sort of Israel aid bill on the floor this week, but said the details are still being finalized. The House GOP Conference will meet Monday evening to discuss the Iran-Israel situation and their legislative plans going forward, according to GOP sources.
    

            It all amounts to a complicated calculation for Johnson. The House previously struggled to pass a standalone Israel aid bill, but Johnson could draw ire from the right if he ties it to Ukraine or puts the Senate bill on the floor.
    

            The speaker has, however, been trying to get former President Donald Trump’s crucial buy-in for a more GOP-friendly Ukraine aid package, such as structuring the aid as a loan — which Trump signaled openness to during a press conference with Johnson at Mar-a-Lago.
    

            President Joe Biden participated in a call with congressional leadership on Sunday afternoon to discuss the “urgent need” for the House to pass the bipartisan Senate-passed aid package.
    

            “The President discussed the urgent need for the House of Representatives to pass the national security supplemental as soon as possible,” the White House said Sunday.
    

            McConnell, Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all participated in the call, according to the White House.
    

            At a news conference Sunday, Schumer urged the GOP-led House to move on the Senate-passed aid package in the wake of the Iranian attack. “The best way to help Israel and to help Ukraine is to pass the supplemental this week,” Schumer said, according to a transcript provided by his office. “I’ve called on Speaker Johnson to do that.”
    

            The House has thus far declined to take a vote on the Senate-passed legislation, with many House conservatives opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine and wanting stricter US southern border policies included in any aid package. But it’s unclear how the Democrat-controlled Senate would approach whatever legislation comes from the GOP-led House.
    

            Individual members have also weighed in on the conflict since the Iranian attacks on Israel, with Democrats imploring Johnson to bring up the Senate foreign aid package as many Republicans call on Schumer to act on Israel only.
    

            Responding to calls from McConnell for the House to bring to the floor the $95.3 billion supplemental foreign aid package that passed the Senate in February, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio sidestepped, insisting on Sunday that the Senate could pass standalone aid to Israel and win House approval.
    

            “We could go on Monday to Washington, DC, and we can pass aid to Israel right away,” Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union,” adding: “If the Senate were to send the House an Israel aid bill on Monday, the House will pass it.”
    

            Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, highlighting the time-sensitive nature of the issue, called on Johnson to bring the supplemental foreign aid package passed by the Senate in February to the floor on Monday.
    

            “I think the most important deterrent action that Congress can take … is for Speaker Johnson to not take days or weeks to try and come up with some other package but to pass the supplemental tomorrow,” Coons told Tapper in a separate interview.
    

    How Congress reached this point


            While the Senate passed its foreign aid bill in February, Johnson said he never planned to bring the bill to the floor. The House, in turn, tried but failed to pass a standalone package for $17.6 billion in Israel aid amid opposition from both Republicans and Democratic leaders.
    

            Because of resistance among members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Johnson had been forced to bring up the bill under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority of the House to approve it. That means he needed the support of a sizable number of Democrats to get behind it, and failed to cross that threshold. At a closed caucus meeting prior to the vote, House Democratic leadership made a forceful case against supporting the standalone Israel aid package to members.
    

            However, given the attacks by Iran and its proxies, leadership in both chambers are under increased pressure to reach a consensus.

Biden tells Netanyahu tonight was a win, nothing of 'value' hit in Israel

CNN
         — 
    


            Israel pledged that it will “exact a price” from Iran as the country weighs its response to an unprecedented overnight barrage of drone and missile strikes while facing international pressure to de-escalate.
    

            The overnight attack – which saw Tehran launch a series of strikes at Israel over a five-hour period – threatens to tip the crisis in the Middle East into an untempered regional war.
    

            Israel’s war cabinet has been authorized to respond to the attack and met on Sunday, with one of its members, Benny Gantz, saying the “event is not over.”
    

            He cited the need to “build a regional coalition and exact a price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.”
    

            Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant earlier said Israel had “thwarted this attack in a way that is unparalleled” but added “we must be prepared for every scenario.” In his first comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “we have intercepted, we have contained. Together we shall win.”
    

            An Israeli official separately told CNN that Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, but the scope of that attack has yet to be decided. The official said Israel is yet to determine whether to try and “break all the dishes” or do something more measured.
    

            But Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate an intensely fraught situation on Sunday and close, at least for now, a weeks-long chapter of uncertainty and confrontation that had spiraled out of Israel’s war with Hamas that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza and caused a humanitarian disaster in the enclave.

How Israel and allied defenses intercepted more than 300 Iranian missiles and drones




            Iran’s retaliatory attack had been anticipated since a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month, and finally came late on Saturday when over 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israeli soil. Approximately 350 rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Israeli authorities said “99%” of the projectiles were intercepted with help from allies including the US, the UK and France. The only injury reported was a 7-year-old girl who was seriously wounded by shrapnel.
    

            The reprisals brought years of clandestine conflict between the countries into the open, and marked the first time the Islamic Republic had launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.
    

            Israel and Iran have long been rivals, but tensions escalated in the wake of Hamas’ attacks on Israel, which left about 1,200 people dead. Iran backs a web of proxies across the Middle East that have frequently clashed with Israel since the attacks.
    

            The war cabinet meeting lasted for hours and ended Sunday night without a decision on how Israel will respond, according to an Israeli official.
    

            The war cabinet is determined to respond but has yet to decide on the timing and scope, the official said. One of the key dilemmas facing the cabinet is determining how quickly Israel should respond. The official said the Israeli military has been tasked with coming up with additional options for a response.
    

    Iran says next attack could be ‘much bigger’


            On Sunday, Iran said a “new equation” in its adversarial relationship with Israel had been opened, and warned of a “much bigger” assault on the country should Netanyahu decide on a tit-for-tat attack.
    

            “We have decided to create a new equation, which is that if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, anywhere, and at any point we will retaliate against them,” the Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Hossein Salami told Iranian state TV. The “Zionist regime” is a term Iran uses to refer to Israel.
    

            Earlier, Sardar Bagheri, the Chief of Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces, had said: “If the Zionist regime responds, our next operation will be much bigger.”
    

            Iran’s attacks targeted the Israeli airbase from which, it said, the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was launched. Iranian ballistic missiles that reached Israel fell on the airbase in southern Israel, and caused only light structural damage, Hagari said.
    

            Bagheri said that from Iran’s perspective, the military operation against Israel “has concluded.” But he emphasized that Iranian armed forces remain on high alert and are prepared to “act if necessary,” according to an interview on state IRINN TV on Sunday.
    

            Those warnings came as Western nations urged Israel to descend from the brink of open warfare with its foe.
    

            After the attack, US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            Israel has told the US that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” a senior Biden administration told reporters Sunday.
    

            “They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.
    

            “The president was very clear that we’re going to help defend Israel, and he made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” the official added.

            Biden has meanwhile reiterated that the US’s commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies remains “ironclad.”
    

            Showing some of the domestic pressure Netanyahu faces, two hardline government ministers called for a firm response. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for a retaliation that “resonates throughout the Middle East,” while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Israel should “go crazy.”
    

            Calls for restraint have also been made across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, a major regional rival to Iran, stressed the importance of “preventing any further exacerbation” of the crisis, while Qatar, which enjoys close economic relations with Iran, expressed “profound concern.” The United Arab Emirates warned of “new levels of instability” if the episode was not closed.
    

            Iran had vowed to retaliate after accusing Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month.
    

The airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.

            The wave of drones and missiles that flew towards Israel overnight on Sunday brought with it a new phase of tension, uncertainty and confrontation in the Middle East.
    

            Iran launched the unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, earlier this month.
    

            It marked a new chapter in a discord between the two states that percolated for years and has spiralled since Israel declared war on Hamas last October.
    

            The next steps remain unclear, but Israel is facing pleas from its allies to step back from the brink of open warfare and choose a path of de-escalation.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

    How did Iran attack Israel?


            More than 300 projectiles – including around 170 drones and over 120 ballistic missiles – were fired toward Israel in the immense aerial attack overnight. Approximately 350 rockets were fired from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari.
    

            However, “99%” of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel’s aerial defense systems and its allies, according to the Israeli military, with only a small number reaching Israeli territory.
    

            Tehran’s attack targeted the Nevatim airbase, an Iranian army official said on Sunday, alleging that this is where Israel’s early April strike on the Iranian consulate was launched from.
    




            Iranian ballistic missiles that reached Israel fell on the airbase in the south of the country and caused only light structural damage, Hagari said. The base is functioning and continuing its operations following the attack, with planes continuing to use the base, Hagari added.
    

            A senior US military official told reporters Sunday that the US assessed “there’s no significant damage within Israel itself.”
    

            US ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea destroyed between four and six Iranian ballistic missiles during the attack and aircraft in the region shot down more than 70 Iranian one-way UAVs headed toward Israel. The US Army Patriot missile battery shot down one ballistic missile in the vicinity of Erbil, Iraq, the official said.
    

    Why did the attack take place?


            Israel and Iran are long-standing rivals and have been engaged in a shadow war for years.
    

            Israel’s war on Hamas, waged since the militant group attacked Israel on October 7, has heightened those tensions.
    

            Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria have launched attacks aimed at US military positions in those countries and Iran’s leadership has warned that attacks by its allies won’t stop until Israel’s war in Gaza ends.
    

            But fears of a spiralling regional war spiked further in early April, when Iran accused Israel of bombing its diplomatic complex in Syria.
    




That airstrike destroyed the consulate building in the capital Damascus, killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, Iran’s foreign ministry said at the time.
    

            Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, was the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.
    

            Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel would be punished for the attack, while President Ebrahim Raisi said it would “not go unanswered,” state news agency IRNA reported. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said the strike would be met with “punishment and revenge.”
    

            The region has been on edge ever since, with the US and Israel warning of intelligence that an Iranian attack was imminent.
    

    How have Israel and its allies responded to the Iranian strike?


            Israel reacted angrily to the unprecedented strikes, while praising its military’s response.
    

            But Israel’s allies in the West urged the country to work to de-escalate the crisis, rather than respond in a way which could tip the situation into open warfare.
    

            US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            After a virtual meeting Sunday, leaders of the G7 condemned in a joint statement the Iranian attack, which it said “risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation.”
    

            “We demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives,” they said.

    What happens next?


            The decisions made by Israel’s War Cabinet will dictate the immediate next steps.
    

            The three-man group met Sunday and then again on Monday, and the attacks sparked a heated debate over how to respond, two Israeli sources told CNN.
    

            The war cabinet remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convened Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, Israeli officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.
    

            One of the members, Benny Gantz said Israel will “exact a price from Iran in a way and time that suits us.”
    

            Israeli government hardliners have called for firm action. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged a response that “resonates throughout the Middle East,” and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Israel should “go crazy.”
    

            Israel told the United States that it’s not “looking for a significant escalation with Iran,” a senior Biden administration told reporters Sunday.
    

            “They’re looking to protect themselves and defend themselves,” the official said.
    

            On Sunday, Iran said a “new equation” in its adversarial relationship with Israel had been opened, and warned of a “much bigger” assault on the country should Netanyahu decide on a tit-for-tat attack.
    

            “We have decided to create a new equation, which is that if from now on the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities, and citizens, anywhere, and at any point, we will retaliate against them,” the Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Hossein Salami told Iranian state TV. The “Zionist regime” is a term Iran uses to refer to Israel.

Here's the latestFrom CNN staff The hours-long Israeli war cabinet meeting ended Sunday night without a decision on how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile and drone attack, an Israeli official said. The cabinet is determined to respond — but has yet to decide on the timing and scope and the official said the military has been tasked with coming up with additional options for a response.Separately, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that an Israeli official told the United States that it's not looking to significantly escalate the showdown with Iran.CNN analyst Barak Ravid said Israeli ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot advocated for swift action, but US President Joe Biden's phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led to a decision to delay the response until the next day. Here are the latest headlines: Retaliation is over, Iran told US: Iran privately messaged the United States that its retaliation against Israel had concluded, echoing what Tehran said publicly, according to a senior administration official. Late Saturday, Iran said its attack on Israel is a response to Israel's strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and ""the matter can be deemed concluded."" However, President Ebrahim Raisi said any “new aggression against the interests of the Iranian nation will be met with a heavier and regrettable response,” according to Iran’s state news channel IRIB. United Nations response: UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a de-escalation of violence after Iran’s attack. Guterres said the United Nations and member countries have a “shared responsibility” to engage “all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.” He also called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. “Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,” he said.G7 and others: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in response to Iran's attack, the G7 nations said they would work together to ""stabilize the situation"" in the Middle East, according to a statement from Biden. Also, Jordan summoned Iran's ambassador in Amman on Sunday after it intercepted Iranian drones over the country.Meanwhile in Gaza: As thousands of Palestinians were turned away from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, a 5-year-old girl was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers, her mother said.

         — 
    


            Oil prices eased on Monday but gold rose and global stocks were mixed as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East spurred demand for safe haven investments after Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel.
    

            The price of Brent crude dipped below $90 a barrel, while US WTI crude dropped by 1% to $84.50 by 4.46 a.m. ET. Traders are waiting to see what Israel does next.
    

            Oil prices hit their highest levels since October on Friday in anticipation of retaliation by Tehran for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria. US crude futures have risen 18% this year. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has surged more than 16%.
    

            Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index ticked up 0.3% in mid-morning trade, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 were up 0.8% and 0.6% respectively. London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4%.
    

            Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 0.7% lower, but China’s Shanghai Composite Index finished 1.3% higher.
    

            Spot gold was up 0.3% at $2,349 per ounce on Monday. It had hit an all-time high of $2,431 per ounce on Friday because of fears of a potential attack by Iran on Israel. So far this year, bullion has surged nearly 14%.
    

            US gold futures traded down 0.3% on Monday. They are up 14% this year.

Why Iran attacked Israel and what comes next




            The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which monitors oil markets on behalf of developed economies, said Monday that Iran’s weekend air attacks on Israeli military facilities had raised the risk of increased volatility in oil markets and provided a fresh reminder of the importance of oil security.
    

            Analysts at ANZ said in a research report that the attack would raise concerns about possible disruption to global oil supply.
    

            “The extent of that risk will likely be determined by the reaction of Israel’s government,” the analysts added.
    

            Israel’s war cabinet met for several hours Sunday to discuss its response and was due to meet again at 7 a.m. ET Monday, an Israeli official told CNN.
    

            The Middle East was plunged into uncharted waters after Iran launched scores of missiles toward Israel late Saturday. Israel’s military said “99%” of the more than 300 projectiles were intercepted by Israel and its partners.
    

            Before Iran’s attack, US stocks ended Friday sharply lower, as Wall Street worried about escalating tension in the Middle East.
    

            US stock futures are cautiously higher after US President Joe Biden and his national security team, seeking to contain the risk of a wider regional war, told their counterparts the US will not participate in any counter-strike against Iran.
    

            Dow futures rose 150 points, or 0.4%, in European hours on Monday. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.6%.

      Can China play a role in avoiding an all-out war in the Middle East?

         — 
    


            China has voiced “deep concern” over escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack on Israel, raising the prospect of a wider conflagration in a region where Beijing has pledged to play peacemaker and promote its own security vision.
    

            “(China) calls on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent further escalation,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday, framing the latest tensions as “a spillover from the Gaza conflict” – which it said should be put to an end as soon as possible.
    

            “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region,” the ministry added.
    

            The Iranian strikes, which Tehran said were retaliation for the bombing of an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus on April 1, marked the first time the Islamic Republic has launched a direct assault on Israel from its soil.
    

            The decision by Iran’s leaders to strike at Israel directly has pushed the shadow war between the two regional foes into the open. Israel is being urged by Western allies to de-escalate, as fears grow of an all-out regional war – a scenario Washington has sought to enlist Beijing’s help to avoid.
    

            Following the Damascus strike, which Iran said killed seven people, including two top Iranian military commanders, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to China’s top diplomat Wang Yi – and other counterparts in Turkey and Saudi Arabia – to “make clear that escalation is not in anyone’s interest, and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate,” according to a US State Department spokesperson.
    

            That was not the first time the US had asked China to influence Iran since the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out last October.
    

            In the wake of Houthi rebels’ assaults on commercial shipping in the Red Sea late last year, American officials repeatedly tried to prod Beijing into pressuring Tehran – which is believed to train, fund and equip the Houthis – to rein in the attacks.
    

            The latest flare-up of tensions has again raised questions over how much leverage China wields over Iran – and whether Beijing is willing to turn its political capital into influence.

            “On paper, China has a great deal of potential leverage over Iran,” said William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
    

            China has been Iran’s biggest trading partner for the past decade and buys 90% of Iran’s oil exports, providing a lifeline to Tehran against US sanctions. Chinese companies also provide Iran with security and surveillance equipment.
    

            In practice, however, it is difficult for China to pull these levers to influence Iran’s behavior, Figueroa said.
    

            “Weaponizing these trade relations, especially in such a high-profile way, would undermine its greater regional strategy of developing close economic ties throughout the Global South.”
    

            China has greatly expanded its economic and political footprint in the Middle East. In recent years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has vowed to “contribute Chinese wisdom to promoting peace and tranquility in the Middle East” as part of his Global Security Initiative to offer an alternative to the Western-led security order.
    

            Last year, Beijing brokered a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two longtime regional rivals, but reining in Iran in the ongoing conflict could prove a thornier task for China, analysts say.
    

            Relations between Beijing and Tehran are already strained by China’s “chronic underinvestment in Iran” despite repeated promises, and previous attempts to influence Iranian policy over the Houthi attacks, Figueroa said.
    

            “While happy to play a role in negotiations, the reality is they lack real coercive power in the region and remain primarily interested in trade and diplomatic initiatives. They are aware of this and not eager to overextend themselves the way they believe the US has done.”
    

            And while China is genuinely concerned about the risk a wider conflict poses to its investment and trade in the region – especially its energy deals, it believes the root cause lies in the conflict in Gaza.
    

            “Therefore, it sees the real solution not in China restraining Iran, but rather in the United States restraining Israel and bringing the conflict to a negotiated settlement that includes a two-state solution,” Figueroa said.
    

    No condemnation for Iranian strikes


            China did not condemn Iran for the weekend’s attack – in contrast to the US and other Western allies, as well as Beijing’s own response following what Tehran says was an Israeli strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month.
    

            Israel did not claim responsibility for the airstrike. However, a military spokesperson told CNN that Israel believes the Iranian building hit in the attack is a “military building of Quds forces” and not a consulate.
    

            Beijing issued a strong condemnation following that airstrike in Damascus.
    

            “The security of diplomatic institutions must not be violated, and the sovereignty and independence of Syria must be respected,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular news conference the day after the attack.

            “Amid the ongoing turbulence in the Middle East, we oppose any act that would escalate the tensions.”
    

            Beijing relayed that message to Washington last week, when Wang stressed in his phone call with Blinken that “China strongly condemns the attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria,” according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
    

            Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China is reluctant to condemn Iran for its retaliatory strikes because it sees Tehran as a victim.
    

            “I think the Chinese are particularly sympathetic to Iran given their own experience of the US bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade. That’s why China does not condemn Iran,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.
    

            During a NATO air raid on the former Yugoslavia in 1999, pilots attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade killing three Chinese journalists.
    

            Bill Clinton, US President at the time, apologized to then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and called the bombing a “tragic accident” resulting from faulty intelligence. Beijing meanwhile denounced the strike as a “barbarian act,” with protests erupting outside US diplomatic compounds across China.
    

            “It’s unlikely, therefore, for China to apply pressure on Iran,” Sun said. “For China, had US applies enough pressure on Israel, neither the Israeli attack nor the Iranian retaliation would have taken place. To apply pressure on Iran, which is seen as the victim at the first place, is illogical.”
    

    Reactions from Asia


            The drastic escalation of tensions has drawn stern responses from other countries in Asia.
    

            Japan’s Prime Minister Kishida said he “strongly condemns” Iran’s attack, which “further aggravates the current situation in the Middle East,” and pledged to continue diplomatic efforts to “prevent the situation from worsening and to calm the situation down.”

            India said it was “seriously concerned” about the escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel and closely monitoring the evolving situation.
    

            “We call for immediate de-escalation, exercise of restraint, stepping back from violence and return to the path of diplomacy,” India’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday.
    

            India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar spoke with Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Sunday to share India’s “concern” after the attacks and to discuss the “larger regional situation.” He also spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and “stressed the importance of avoiding escalation, exercising restraint and returning to diplomacy,” according to his post on social platform X.
    

            The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia have also called for restrain from further escalation.

         — 
    


            Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel over the weekend has ratcheted up tensions in the oil-rich Middle East yet again, threatening to send fuel prices skyward if the conflict escalates and disrupts global supplies.
    

            Iran launched scores of missiles toward Israel late Saturday in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria on April 1. Israel’s military said that “99%” of the more than 300 projectiles were intercepted.
    

            Oil prices spiked Friday to levels not seen since October in anticipation of just such an escalation but on Monday were subdued. Brent, the global benchmark, was trading down 0.9%; West Texas Intermediate futures, the US benchmark, were down 0.8% by 9.25 am ET as markets wait to see how Israel will respond.

Oil prices dip but gold climbs as Israel weighs response to Iran’s attack




            Members of Israel’s war cabinet were locked in heated debate over the nature of its response, with military and diplomatic options both being considered, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations told CNN.


            The deepening conflict raises “the risk of increased volatility in oil markets and (provides) a fresh reminder of the importance of oil security,” the Paris-based International Energy Agency, which monitors oil markets on behalf of developed economies, said in a note Monday.
    

            Tensions between Israel and its arch-enemy Iran have ratcheted up since October 7, when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. That attack sparked a devastating response from Israel — more than 30,000 people have died since Israel launched its counter-attack on Gaza, the strip of land controlled by Hamas.
    

            Israel has long accused Iran of engaging in a form of proxy war by backing groups — including Hamas — that have launched attacks on its shores. Tehran has denied any involvement in the October 7 attacks.
    

    The Strait of Hormuz ‘chokepoint’


            Iran’s attack raises the possibility that the conflict could disrupt shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway off the country’s southern border through which more than one quarter of global maritime oil trade — including crude and petroleum products such as gasoline — flows each day.
    

            If the conflict escalates further, Iran has the capability to attack oil tankers passing through the strait using drones, missiles or submarines, Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, told CNN. A worst-case scenario would entail a total blockade of the strait by Tehran, he added, though the likelihood of either of these outcomes is currently low.
    

            “It is the most significant chokepoint in the global oil market,” Richard Bronze, co-founder and analyst at data firm Energy Aspects, told CNN. “Any significant disruption would have a huge impact on global oil supplies and oil prices as a result.”
    

            Iran is a big producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries but exports most of its oil to China because of long-standing international sanctions. Still, a reduction in Iranian oil exports would have a “massive” impact on the global market, according to Bronze, as China would be forced to compete with other countries for supplies elsewhere.
    

            Iran exports up to 1.5 million barrels a day of crude, Bronze said, equivalent to 1.5% of global oil supply. The country produced a total 3.25 million barrels per day of crude in March, IEA data shows.
    





            Disruption or blockages to traffic in the Strait of Hormuz would be a game-changer. “It’s the main or only route for the Middle Eastern oil exporters,” including OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, Bronze said.
    

            Still, Bronze sees the “most likely path from here (to be) de-escalation rather than further escalation,” given open calls by Israel’s allies for it to show restraint.
    

            Another possibility is that the United States, Israel’s most important ally, retaliates by cracking down again on Iran’s oil exports, according to Tagliapietra.
    

            Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 upended energy markets worldwide, Washington has relaxed enforcement of its sanctions on Iran’s oil to keep global supplies — and prices — of the fuel stable, he said.
    

            A renewed crackdown would, however, “create upward pressure on global prices” at an inopportune moment, Tagliapietra said. The US is ju﻿st months from a presidential election where President Joe Biden’s record on gasoline prices, and inflation in general, will be closely scrutinized.
    

    A tight oil market


            Despite Iran’s barrage of drones and missiles, the conflict had a relatively muted impact on the global oil market Monday. Traders had been anticipating a retaliatory attack by Iran since the bombing of its embassy in Damascus in early April, and expected a tightening of global supplies over the coming months, analysts told CNN.
    

            Oil prices have already risen sharply since hitting a low in early February. Brent has climbed more than 16% in that time — closing above $90 a barrel in early April for the first time since October — while WTI has risen nearly 19% to hit $85 a barrel.
    

            “The reason that we’re seeing oil prices off a little bit so far today is that those prices had already risen last week in anticipation of an attack (by Iran),” Bronze, at Energy Aspects, said.
    

            A seasonal uptick in demand as many countries approach the busy summer months, as well as a roaring US economy and signs of an improving Chinese economy, have provided a tailwind for prices, he added, noting that prolonged export curbs by OPEC+ — OPEC plus allies including Russia — have kept global supplies of crude tight.
    

            Still, according to the IEA, output from non-OPEC+ producers, driven by the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada, is expected to come close to meeting the global growth in oil demand this year and next.

      Israel delays Rafah offensive plans amid heated debate over response to Iranian attack, sources say

Israel's War Cabinet met Sunday but did not reach a decision on how to respond.

         — 
    


            Israel was set to take its first steps towards a ground offensive on the Gaza city of Rafah but delayed that campaign after Iran’s weekend attack on their country, which has sparked a heated debate in the war cabinet over how to respond, Israeli sources have told CNN.
    

            The Israeli Air Force was set to begin dropping leaflets on parts of Rafah on Monday, two Israeli sources said, amid preparations for a ground offensive into Gaza’s southernmost city where more than 1 million people are sheltering.
    

            Those plans were paused after a retaliatory weekend attack from Iran, which saw more than 300 projectiles fired towards Israel, the vast majority of which were intercepted by Israel and its partners.
    

            One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah, although the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment.
    

            The Israeli military declined to comment.
    

            The war cabinet meanwhile remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convened Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, the officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.
    

            Monday’s meeting ended late afternoon local time, an Israeli official confirmed to CNN, adding they had no initial details on what was discussed or decided.

Israel weighs response after Iran fires missile barrage




            Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision.
    

            Gantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran’s attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, the sources said. Multiple countries are already cautioning Israel against escalating the situation further with a military response.
    

            Israel’s government is aware that the country is currently enjoying international support and good will from its allies and does not want to squander that. At the same time, the government recognizes that it cannot allow Iran’s first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.
    

            Among the military options that are being considered, the war cabinet is consider an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message, but would avoid causing casualties, one Israeli official said.
    

            But Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, hence the ongoing debate. The timing of a decision remains unclear.
    

    Pressure to de-escalate


            Netanyahu has been facing international pressure to de-escalate a fraught situation after Iran’s weekend attack.
    

            The attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month, which killed at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi.
    

            An hours-long war cabinet meeting on Sunday ended without a decision on how Israel will respond to Iran’s attack, an Israeli official said.
    

            US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu after the weekend attack, and made clear that the US would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, a senior White House administration official told CNN.
    

            Biden told Netanyahu he should consider the events of Saturday night a “win” as Iran’s attacks had been largely unsuccessful, and instead demonstrated Israel’s “remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks.”
    

            But Gantz urged on Sunday the need to “build a regional coalition and exact a price from Iran, in a way and at a time that suits us.”
    

            Israel and Iran have long been rivals, but tensions escalated in the wake of Hamas’ attacks on Israel, which left about 1,200 people dead. Iran backs a web of proxies across the Middle East that have frequently clashed with Israel since the attacks.
    

    Offensive looming in Rafah


            Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas’s remaining battalions, despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive.
    

            The future of the war in Gaza and a coming ground offensive in Rafah are also factoring into the war cabinet’s debate about a potential response to Iran’s attack.
    

            A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military’s attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel’s government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.

            American officials reiterated last week that the US has not seen anything resembling a comprehensive plan from the Israelis on how they would carry out such an operation, including first moving the majority of the estimated 1.4 million civilians out of Rafah.
    

            Palestinians from across Gaza fled to the city, in the south of the enclave, in the early stages of the war to escape an advancing Israeli military.
    

            But with the Egyptian border to the south closed, there is no clear escape route for those Palestinians, many of whom are living in tents surrounding the city.

Blinken noted he has been in contact with counterparts in the region “and will continue to do so in the hours and days ahead.”“We don’t seek escalation but will continue to support the defense of Israel and protect our personnel in the region,” Blinken said in his first public comments about the attack this weekend.As CNN reported, President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US would not participate in offensive moves against Iran. But, he added that ""what this weekend demonstrated is that Israel did not have to and does not have to defend itself alone when it is the victim of aggression, the victim of an attack.""share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link1 hr 43 min agoIsrael's war cabinet meeting on Iran attack response has endedFrom CNN's Eugenia YosefAn Israeli official has confirmed to CNN that the war cabinet meeting is over. The official said that at this stage they had no details on what was discussed or decided.The war cabinet met to deliberate over the timing and scope of a response to Iran's attack on Israel, the officials said.

Abed Zagout/Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael was set to take its first steps toward a ground offensive in Rafah this week, but has delayed those plans as it mulls a response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli sources tell CNN.Iran launched 300 missiles and drones toward Israel overnight Sunday, bringing a new phase of tension, uncertainty and confrontation in the Middle East.The attack has prompted Israel to delay its plans for an offensive in Rafah, where more than a million people are currently sheltering. The Israeli Air Force had planned on dropping leaflets on parts of the city on Monday, the sources said. One Israeli official said Israel remains determined to carry out a ground offensive in the southern city, although the timing of civilian evacuations and the coming ground offensive remains unclear at the moment. The Israeli military declined to comment.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stressed the importance of invading Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas’s remaining battalions, despite significant pressure from the United States to call off an all-out ground offensive. The future of the war in Gaza and a coming ground offensive in Rafah are also factoring into the war cabinet’s debate about a potential response to Iran’s attack.A military response that risks escalating the conflict with Iran further would pull the military’s attention and resources away from Gaza, where Israel’s government has vowed to hand Hamas a total defeat.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3 hr 21 min agoBiden focused on preventing Iran attack from spiraling into wider regional conflict, White House official saysFrom CNN’s Sam Fossum President Joe Biden meets with members of the National Security team regarding the unfolding missile attacks on Israel from Iran on Saturday evening in the White House Situation Room. Some portions of this handout photo have been blurred by the source. Adam Schultz/The White HouseWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby reiterated Monday morning that President Joe Biden is focused on preventing Iran’s attack against Israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict. “Just because Iran conducted this unprecedented attack, which we and our Israeli partners and other partners thwarted, doesn't mean that we should just accept a constant rising escalation in the region. The President is not going to accept that he wants to see things de-escalate,” Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan this morning.Pressed on whether it’s the White House position that Israel should not retaliate, Kirby said that’s ultimately up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government but that the US wants to see tensions de-escalate. “We respect their sovereign decision-making process. What we want to see is de-escalation of the tensions. We don't want to see a wider war,"" Kirby said.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link3 hr 44 min agoPalestinian girl shot in mother's arms as they attempted to return to home in northern GazaFrom Mohammad Al-Sawalhi in Gaza and CNN’s Abeer Salman, Kareem Khadder and Zeena Saifi in JerusalemAs chaos ensued after thousands of Palestinians were turned away from returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, a 5-year-old girl was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers, her mother said.Video shows a man carrying a 5-year-old girl named Sally Abu Laila, who was bleeding from her head, with people crowding around her in panic trying to cover her wound.Her mother Sabreen told CNN her daughter was in her arms when Israeli soldiers shot at her.

I saw my hands covered in blood. I called on her, ‘Sally! Sally! Sally!’, but she didn’t answer” Sabreen said.Eventually, she said she managed to get to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital where her daughter is undergoing treatment.

Portions of this photo have been blurred by the source. Ariel Hermoni/Israeli Ministry of Defense/FileIsrael’s war cabinet has been engaged in a heated debate about how and when to respond to Iran’s weekend attack on their country, two Israeli officials familiar with the deliberations tell CNN.The war cabinet remains determined to respond to Iran’s attack, but as it convenes Monday afternoon, its members continue to debate the timing and scope of such a response, the officials said. In addition to a potential military response, the war cabinet is also mulling diplomatic options to further isolate Iran on the world stage.Benny Gantz, a key member of the war cabinet, has pushed for a swifter response to Iran’s attack, two Israeli officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far pumped the brakes on making a decision. Gantz believes that the longer Israel delays its response to Iran’s attack, the harder it will be to garner international support for such an attack, one of the sources said. Multiple countries are already cautioning Israel against escalating the situation further with a military response.Israel’s government is aware that the country is currently enjoying international support and goodwill from its allies and does not want to squander that. At the same time, the government recognizes that it cannot allow Iran’s first attack on Israeli soil to go unanswered.Among the military options that are being considered, the war cabinet is considering an attack on an Iranian facility that would send a message, but would avoid causing casualties, one Israeli official said. But Israeli officials recognize that will be a difficult needle to thread, hence the ongoing debate. The timing of a decision remains unclear.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4 hr 52 min agoJordan's foreign minister says Netanyahu is using confrontation with Iran to take attention away from GazaFrom CNN’s Celine AlkhaldiRescue workers search in the rubble of a building annexed to the Iranian embassy a day after an Israeli air strike in Damascus, Syria, on April 2. Louai Beshara/AFP/Getty ImagesJordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi told CNN Monday he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is using the fight with Iran to take attention away from the war on Gaza.""The Israeli Prime Minister has always wanted to invoke some sort of confrontation with Iran. Now, as the international pressure on Israel to stop the aggression on Gaza continues, invoking a fight with Iran is something that, we believe, he thinks could dilute that pressure, and could take attention away from Gaza,"" Safadi told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “The issue is in Gaza and the West Bank, and our focus needs to continue to be on that because unless we solve that, then the chances for regional escalation will continue,” Safadi said.More on Iran's attack: Safadi said Jordan will do whatever is within its means to protect the kingdom, explaining why the country intercepted some of the drones and missiles that entered its airspace Saturday night.“What we did was consistent with our long-standing policy and any projectiles, drones, whatever that enters our space historically and we'll continue to deal with it because it poses a threat to Jordan,” Safadi said. “We are in the range of fire and any missiles or projectile that could fall in Jordan would cause harm to Jordan. So we did what we have to do and let me be very clear. We will do the same regardless of where those drones are from. From Israel, from Iran, from anybody else,” he added.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare linkSearchAudioWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsSCOTUSCongressFacts First2024 ElectionBusinessTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosMarketsPre-marketsAfter-HoursMarket MoversFear & GreedWorld MarketsInvestingMarkets NowBefore the BellNightcapHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionCelebrityTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfMotorsportUS SportsOlympicsClimbingEsportsVideosLive TV CNN HeadlinesCNN ShortsShows A-ZCNN10CNN MaxFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoAbout CNNPhotosInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNWorldAudioFollow CNN Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility & CCAd ChoicesAbout UsModern Slavery Act StatementAdvertise with usCNN StoreNewslettersTranscriptsLicense FootageCNN NewsourceSitemap© 2024 Cable News Network.A Warner Bros.
